# V10.0 Quality Investigation Report
**Analysis Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Investigator:** Arden  
**Module:** `ty_extract_v10.0_qwen3_optimized`

---

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **The Problem:**
Despite using the **winning model (qwen3:latest)** from our template test, V10.0 is producing **inconsistent quality** with some jobs scoring only **17/25** compared to the **95/100** quality we saw in the standalone template test.

---

## üéØ **KEY FINDINGS**

### **1. PROMPT DISCREPANCY** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Issue**: V10.0 uses a **different prompt** than our validated template!

**Template Test Prompt** (Perfect Results):
```markdown
## {job_title} - Requirements & Responsibilities

  ### Your Tasks
* [Category]: [Detailed responsibility description]
```

**V10.0 Prompt** (Inconsistent Results):
```markdown
## [Job Title] - Requirements & Responsibilities

### Your Tasks
* [Main Category]: [Detailed description of primary responsibilities]
```

**Impact**: Different prompt structure leads to different quality levels!

---

### **2. OUTPUT FORMAT INCONSISTENCY** ‚ùå

**Good Output (Job #1 - Score 25/25)**:
```markdown
## Business Analyst (E-invoicing) - Requirements & Responsibilities

### Your Tasks
* **Process Development & Implementation**: Design and implement...
* **Data Management & Verification**: Validate invoice information...
```
‚úÖ **Perfect template compliance**

**Bad Output (Job #2 - Score 17/25)**:
```markdown
**Key Responsibilities:**  
- Conduct information security third-party risk assessments...

**Skills and Experience:**  
- Proven experience in IT security...

**Company Benefits:**  
- **Mental Health Support:** Access to counseling...
```
‚ùå **TEMPLATE VIOLATION**: Wrong format, includes banned "Company Benefits"!

---

### **3. MODEL INCONSISTENCY** üîÑ
**Same model (qwen3:latest)** is producing **wildly different formats**:
- **Job #1**: Perfect "Your Tasks"/"Your Profile" format
- **Job #2**: Completely wrong format with benefits section
- **Jobs #3-5**: Correct format again

**Conclusion**: The prompt is not **constraining the model** effectively!

---

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

### **Issue #1: Weak Prompt Engineering**
- V10.0 prompt is **too permissive**
- Allows model to deviate from required format
- No explicit constraints against "benefits" sections

### **Issue #2: Missing CV Matching Focus**
- V10.0 prompt doesn't emphasize **CV matching purpose**
- No explicit instruction to **exclude benefits/company info**
- Missing the key principle we documented in the SOP

### **Issue #3: Format Validation Failure**
- No post-processing validation to ensure format compliance
- Quality scoring doesn't penalize format violations heavily enough
- Allows "Company Benefits" contamination to slip through

---

## üí° **SOLUTION RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **1. IMMEDIATE FIX: Update V10.0 Prompt** üîß
Replace the current prompt with our **validated template prompt** that scored 95/100:

```markdown
# Use EXACT prompt from: 
# /home/xai/Documents/ty_learn/0_mailboxes/arden/inbox/archive/2025-07-20_template_concise_job_description.md
```

### **2. ADD CV MATCHING CONSTRAINTS** üéØ
Enhance prompt with explicit CV matching focus:
```markdown
## CRITICAL: CV Matching Focus
- NEVER include "What We Offer", "Benefits", or "Company Culture" sections
- ONLY extract job requirements and responsibilities  
- Focus purely on candidate requirements and job tasks
```

### **3. IMPLEMENT FORMAT VALIDATION** ‚úÖ
Add post-processing validation:
- Check for required "### Your Tasks" and "### Your Profile" headers
- Reject outputs containing "Benefits", "What We Offer", "Company Culture"
- Auto-retry with stricter prompt if format violations detected

### **4. QUALITY SCORING ENHANCEMENT** üìä
Update quality scoring to:
- **Automatic 0/25** for format violations
- **Heavy penalties** for benefits/company info inclusion
- **Bonus points** for perfect template compliance

---

## üöÄ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Update V10.0 prompt** to use validated template
2. **Add CV matching constraints** 
3. **Implement format validation**
4. **Re-test against same job set**
5. **Validate quality improvement**

**Expected Result**: Consistent 20-25/25 quality scores matching our template test results.

---

**Bottom Line**: V10.0's inconsistent quality is due to **prompt engineering issues**, not model capability. qwen3:latest is excellent when given the right constraints!
