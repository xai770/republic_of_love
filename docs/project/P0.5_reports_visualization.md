### Key Features

1. **UMAP clustering** — Skills group by semantic similarity
2. **Auto-labeled clusters** — "Negotiation", "Management", "Strategy"
3. **Verdict box** — One-glance assessment
4. **Matched pairs** — Lines connect profile skill ↔ job requirement
5. **Relevant only** — Default hides unrelated profile skills

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tools/match_report.py` | Generate markdown reports |
| `tools/clara_visualizer.py` | UMAP visualization |
| `output/match_report_*.md` | Generated reports |

## Lessons Learned

1. **High score ≠ good fit** — 89% match + domain mismatch = SKIP
2. **Transparency builds trust** — Show the math, not just the number
3. **UMAP > forced quadrants** — Let embedding space reveal structure
4. **Wife test passed** — "Green/yellow/red + verdict box = one glance decision"
