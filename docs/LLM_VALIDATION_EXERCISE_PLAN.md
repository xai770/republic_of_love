**Project**: Validate Orrin's Recommended LLMs with Structured Prompt  
**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Objective**: Test production-grade LLMs for next-generation ty_extract system  
**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATION COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

## 📋 **Project Overview**

### **Background**
- Arden identified V7.1 as gold standard for structured job descriptions
- Custom structured prompt developed based on V7.1 "Your Tasks"/"Your Profile" format

- Need to validate these LLMs work reliably with our exact structured prompt

### **Success Criteria**
1. ✅ LLMs produce consistent V7.1-style structured output
2. ✅ Quality matches or exceeds current extraction standards
3. ✅ Scalable to 10+ job descriptions with reliable results
4. ✅ Clear path to new ty_extract version implementation
