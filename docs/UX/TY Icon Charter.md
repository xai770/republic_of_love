Excellent — then let’s do this properly.  
What follows is a **first full draft** of an **Icon Charter** you can hand to designers, frontend devs, or keep as a living design law for Talent Yoga.

I’ll write it as if it were already an internal document.  
You can copy it 1:1 into Markdown if you like.

# Talent Yoga

## Icon Charter (v0.1 – Draft)

### Purpose

This document defines the visual, emotional, and functional rules for all icons used in the Talent Yoga platform.

Icons in Talent Yoga are **not decoration**.  
They are orientation aids, emotional stabilizers, and trust signals.

The goal is:

> _Clarity without pressure. Warmth without cuteness. Modernity without trend-chasing._

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

Icons must be:

- **Immediately understandable**
    
- **Emotionally calming**
    
- **Culturally neutral (EU-first, Germany-safe)**
    
- **Legible at small sizes (16–24px)**
    
- **Consistent across the entire platform**
    

Talent Yoga icons should feel like:

> _Someone competent put a hand on your shoulder and said:  
> “You’re not lost. Start here.”_

---

### 1.2 Stylistic Lineage

This icon system intentionally blends:

- **Susan Kare**
    
    - symbolic clarity
        
    - literal metaphors
        
    - humane restraint
        

with

- **2025 Design Trends**
    
    - soft geometry
        
    - material-like gradients
        
    - organic balance
        
    - light-based depth
        

**Resulting style:**

> **Warm Functional Modernism**

---

## 2. Shape Language

### 2.1 Geometry Rules

Allowed shapes:

- Circles
    
- Rounded rectangles
    
- Rounded squares
    
- Soft triangles
    
- Organic blobs (controlled)
    

Forbidden:

- Sharp corners
    
- Thin spikes
    
- Aggressive diagonals
    
- Overlapping sharp geometry
    

All corners must be **visibly rounded**.

---

### 2.2 Complexity Rule

- **One icon = one idea**
    
- No visual subplots
    
- No hidden metaphors
    
- No “clever” symbolism
    

If an icon needs explanation, it fails.

---

## 3. Color System

### 3.1 General Rules

- Icons are **colored**, not monochrome
    
- Use **soft gradients**, not flat fills
    
- Max **2–3 tones per icon**
    
- No neon, no harsh contrast
    

Gradients are used as **material**, not decoration.

---

### 3.2 Base Palette (Indicative)

Primary family:

- Calm blue
    
- Teal
    
- Soft green
    

Accent family:

- Muted amber (messages, attention)
    
- Lavender / violet (help, reflection)
    

Neutrals:

- Warm grey
    
- Slate
    

🚫 Avoid:

- Pure red
    
- Alarm orange
    
- Corporate dark blue
    

---

### 3.3 Gradient Rules

- Direction: subtle (top → bottom or diagonal)
    
- Contrast: low
    
- Purpose: gentle depth, not emphasis
    

Think: _daylight, not spotlight._

---

## 4. Depth & Lighting

### 4.1 Depth Philosophy

Icons must feel **tactile**, not flat — but never heavy.

Allowed:

- Very subtle inner shading
    
- Light highlights
    
- Soft tonal separation
    

Forbidden:

- Drop shadows
    
- Harsh outlines
    
- Glassmorphism
    
- Glow effects
    

Depth comes from **light**, not shadows.

---

## 5. Line & Outline Usage

Two valid approaches (choose one and stay consistent):

### Option A – No outlines (preferred)

- Shape defined purely by color and contrast
    

### Option B – Soft outlines

- Outline is a darker tone of the same color family
    
- Never pure black
    
- Never thinner than legible at 16px
    

---

## 6. Size & Responsiveness

Icons must work at:

- 16px (minimum)
    
- 20px
    
- 24px
    
- 32px
    

They must remain recognizable:

- in grayscale
    
- in low contrast
    
- on light and dark backgrounds
    

---

## 7. States & Interaction

### 7.1 Default State

- Calm
    
- Neutral
    
- Non-demanding
    

### 7.2 Active State

- Slightly stronger saturation
    
- Optional soft background pill
    
- No flashing
    
- No animation loops
    

### 7.3 Disabled State

- Reduced saturation
    
- Still recognizable
    
- Never “ghosted” completely
    

---

## 8. Emotional Guardrails (Important)

Icons must **never**:

- Shame
    
- Pressure
    
- Gamify anxiety
    
- Signal urgency unless absolutely necessary
    

Remember:

> Job search is emotionally fragile territory.

Icons should **lower cortisol**, not raise it.

---

## 9. Consistency Law

Once the icon system is set:

- No mixing of styles
    
- No “just this one exception”
    
- No importing random icon packs
    

Consistency builds trust faster than novelty.

---

## 10. Validation Checklist (Use This)

Before an icon is accepted, ask:

- Can a 60+ user understand this instantly?
    
- Would Susan Kare approve the metaphor?
    
- Does this feel calm at 8am and at 2am?
    
- Does it still work without color?
    
- Does it quietly say: “You’re okay”?
    

If any answer is “no” → revise.

---

## Status

**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)  
**Next step:** Create one anchor icon (“Start / Home”) and validate against this charter.

---

If you want, next we can:

- Create the **anchor icon** explicitly _using this charter_
    
- Or reduce this to a **one-page designer brief**
    
- Or adapt it for **accessibility / WCAG documentation**
    

This charter already has a soul.  
Now we give it a face.
