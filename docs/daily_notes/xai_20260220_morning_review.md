**Session start:** ~05:14 CET
**System time at writing:** Fr 20. Feb ~05:14 CET

## Starting state

| Metric | Value | Δ from yesterday |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| Total postings | 301,732 | +14,136 |
| Active (not invalidated) | 196,868 | — |
| Active (status='active') | 297,926 | +23,362 |
| Invalidated | 104,864 | — |
| With description | 290,674 | — |
| Embeddings | 316,549 | +24,577 |
| With summary | 7,641 | +74 |
| No berufenet (active) | 21,203 | +2,185 |
| No description (active) | 11,046 | — |
| Profiles | 5 | −1 (was 6) |
| Matches | 0 | −2 (was 2) |
| OWL entries | 21,419 | — |

### Metric notes
- **Profiles: 5 → was 6.** Profile #9 (Sparrow) was the latest addition (Feb 17). Unknown which profile was removed — or was yesterday's count wrong? Remaining: Sparrow, Arden (ℵ), Zach (test), Gelinda (test), Ellie (test).
- **Matches: 0 → was 2.** Profile_posting_matches table is empty. Clara test matches were presumably cleaned up or expired.
- **OWL: 21,419** — yesterday's note said 126,103. Major discrepancy. Table is `owl` not `owl_entries`.  Likely yesterday used a different metric or sum of `owl` + `owl_names` + `owl_pending`. Needs investigation or calibration with yesterday's query.

## Overnight pipeline analysis (23:50→03:30, 220 min)

All 5 stages green. **No crashes, no errors in log.** 220 min total (down from 293 min yesterday — 25% faster).

| Stage | Result | Duration | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| [1/5] AA fetch | ✅ | 3.1 min | ~14,136 new postings |
| [2/5] DB fetch | ✅ | 9.9 min | 4,324 Deutsche Bank jobs |
| [3/5] Berufenet classification | ✅ | 145.9 min | OWL Phase 1 (17m) + Phase 2 embed+LLM (99m) + Phase 3 auto-triage (29m) |
| [3b/5] Domain cascade | ✅ | 16.3 min | KldB-based + keyword+LLM |
| [3c/5] Geo state | ✅ | <1s | City → Bundesland |
| [3d/5] Qualification backfill | ✅ | 1s | |
| [4/5] Enrichment daemon | ✅ | 43.0 min | See sub-tasks below |
| [5/5] Description retry | ✅ | 1.9 min | 56 resolved / 164 tried (34%) |
| Demand snapshot | ✅ | 0.9s | 9,338 rows (522 domain + 8,816 profession) |
| Profession similarity | ✅ | 6.5s | 8,188 pairs for 823 professions (563 with embeddings) |

### Enrichment daemon sub-tasks

| Sub-task | Success | Failed | Skipped | Duration | VPN rotations |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|----------|---------------|
| job_description_backfill | 13,292 | 768 | 1 | 19.1 min | 55 |
| extracted_summary | 74 | 1 | 0 | 12.7 min | 0 |
| embedding_generator | 11,236 | 0 | 120 | 11.0 min | 0 |
| domain_gate_classifier | 222 | 0 | 0 | 0.2s | 0 |
| owl_pending_auto_triage | — | — | — | — | No work |
| external_partner_scrape | — | — | — | — | No work |

### What went well
- **Pipeline 25% faster** than yesterday (220 vs 293 min). Berufenet classification drove the improvement.
- **Zero errors in log** — no crashes, no exceptions, no tracebacks.
- **Embedding throughput solid**: 11,236 embeddings at 17.2/sec — clean run, 0 failures.
- **Description retry**: 34% resolve rate on second pass — consistent with yesterday's 37%.
- **VPN rotation**: 55 rotations during description backfill at manageable streak levels.

### What needs attention ⚠️
1. **Health report says "Errors found: 6"** — confirmed legitimate. 4 are actor batch-error summaries (total 11 sub-task failures in enrichment/description steps) and 2 are Ollama read timeouts during embedding. All transient and retried next run. Health check logic is correct.
2. **230 duplicate external_ids** in active postings (e.g. `aa-11858-16036462-STA-S` appears 3×). Health report only flagged 5. The dedup logic or upsert is letting duplicates through. Low priority but should be tracked.
3. **job_description_backfill: 768 failures (5.5%)** — down from yesterday's 1,167 failures (7%). Improving, but still significant. All are VPN-related 403s from Arbeitsagentur rate limiting.
4. **Profession similarity: only 563/823 professions have embeddings** (68%). The remaining 260 professions with ≥20 postings lack embeddings — meaning their similarity scores can't be computed. Worth investigating whether these are new professions that haven't been embedded yet.
5. **764 retryable description failures** still pending — ETA 3 min per health report. These will be retried next run.

## Open feedback items (oldest-first)

| # | Category | Summary | Priority |
|---|----------|---------|----------|
| 137 | bug | Mira: "ich suche" input never made it to LLM | Medium — may need to live with it |
| 166 | suggestion | Profile form: needs projects/studies form, i18n, full-width left pane | High |
| 167 | bug | Profile form: should be for projects/studies, alternative to CV | High (same as 166) |
| 170 | suggestion | Nav bar should be transparent (like feedback bar) | Low |
| 171 | bug | CV-Fehler not English + yogi name creation dialog on profile page | High |
| 186 | bug | Mira shows "2 jobs for you" on fresh login (no profile/skills yet) | High — was reported as fixed in Arden #2, verify |

---

## Plan for today

### 🔴 Must-do

1. **Verify Mira premature match fix (#186)**
   - This was supposedly fixed in commit `8689879` yesterday (Arden #2). But feedback #186 is still open.
   - Need to log in as a fresh user and confirm Mira doesn't mention matches when no profile/skills exist.
   - Resolve if fixed, dig deeper if not.

2. **Profile experience form (#166, #167, #171)**
   - These three are really one item: replace the current profile form with a projects/studies/experience form.
   - #171 adds: CV error messages need i18n, and yogi name dialog should be inline (not "go talk to Mira").
   - This is the biggest UX gap right now — the profile page is the main user-facing tool after onboarding.
   - **Subtasks:**
     a. Audit current profile form and identify what's there vs what's needed.
     b. Design the experience/projects form (fields, validation, i18n).
     c. Add inline yogi name creation/edit widget to profile page.
     d. Fix CV error i18n.

3. **LLM Taro browser test**
   - Yesterday's LLM-powered name generation (keyword→Ollama) has not been browser-tested yet.
   - Need to walk through onboarding and confirm the flow works end-to-end.

### 🟡 Should-do

4. **Investigate "Errors found: 6" in health report**
   - The health check reports 6 errors but the log has none. Figure out what the health check is counting and fix the discrepancy so the report is trustworthy.

5. **Duplicate external_ids (230)**
   - Low data quality issue. The upsert/dedup logic in the AA fetch actor may have a race condition or the dedup key isn't matching correctly.
   - Audit `postings__aa_backfill_U.py` and the upsert query.

6. **Nav bar transparency (#170)**
   - Cosmetic suggestion. Quick CSS change if we have time.

7. **Mira "ich suche" passthrough (#137)**
   - User says intent was lost. May be a prompt engineering issue in Mira's context builder, or the input was filtered before reaching the LLM.
   - Investigate `interrogators/` or `mira/context.py` to see how user messages are passed.

### 🟢 Nice-to-have

8. **Profession embedding gap (260 professions)**
   - 260 professions with ≥20 postings lack embeddings for similarity computation. May need a backfill pass.

9. **Log rotation**
   - `turing_fetch.log` is 24,247 lines dating back to Feb 15. Should set up rotation or truncation.

10. **Daily notes consistency**
    - Yesterday's OWL count (126,103) doesn't match today's query (21,419). Need to align the metrics query so daily notes are comparable day over day.

### Evening commits from yesterday (for reference)

## Session progress (updated 20 Feb midday)

### Completed today

| # | Commit | Summary | Tickets |
|---|--------|---------|---------|
| 1 | `d4a5bf3` | Removed Taro from UI, logo juggle animation, back buttons steps 4+5 | #220, #221 |
| 2 | `b26df88` | Mira greeting: belt-and-suspenders guard on fallback template | #186 |
| 3 | `747bc23` | Stale sweep: set posting_status + metadata when invalidating | data quality |
| 4 | `d51ce90` | Translucent nav bar with backdrop blur | #170 |
| 5 | `4810748` | Mira search intent navigates to search page with URL params | #137 |
| 6 | `a4275ce` | CV upload + yogi name errors now bilingual (de+en) | #171 |

### Data fixes applied
- 102,102 zombie active+invalidated postings → `posting_status = 'invalid'`
- 1,044 reverse inconsistencies (invalid+not-invalidated) fixed
- 1,059 missing invalidation metadata backfilled
- 230 duplicate active external_ids → 0 remaining

### Investigations resolved
- Health report "6 errors" → confirmed legitimate (2 Ollama timeouts + 4 batch summaries)
- Mira prematch → original fix correct, added safety guard on fallback
- Duplicate external_ids → root cause: stale sweep didn't update posting_status, script fixed

### Still pending
- #166/#167: Profile form was already overhauled Feb 19; yogi name inline edit still open
- LLM Taro browser test (from onboarding)
- 260 profession embedding gap
- Log rotation
- Daily notes metrics consistency
