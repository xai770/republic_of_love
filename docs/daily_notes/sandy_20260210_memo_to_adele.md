# Memo to Adele — 2026 Objectives Context

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**From:** Sandy (via Gershon)  
**To:** Adele (HR Coach)  
**Re:** What Gershon has been building — for objectives discussion

---

## What It Is

**talent.yoga** is a job matching platform for the German market. Skills-based matching using AI embeddings, not keyword search.

It exists. It works. It's being tested.

## What's Built (Facts)

| Component | Status | Numbers |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Job postings database | ✅ Live | ~100,000+ from Arbeitsagentur + Deutsche Bank |
| Embedding-based matching | ✅ Working | BGE-M3 multilingual model |
| Qualification classification | ✅ Working | Berufenet integration (75% coverage) |
| Salary data | ✅ Working | 99.99% coverage via Entgeltatlas API |
| User authentication | ✅ Working | Google OAuth |
| AI companion (Mira) | ✅ Working | Conversational assistant with memory |
| Company research (Doug) | ✅ Working | Automated reports + daily newsletter |
| Nightly data pipeline | ✅ Working | Automated fetch, embed, classify |
| Web interface | ✅ Working | Dashboard, matches, messages |

## What Gershon Did

Built the entire system over the past year. Specifically:

1. **Architecture** — Designed the embedding-first approach that skips traditional keyword matching
2. **Data pipeline** — Built automated scraping, processing, and embedding infrastructure
3. **AI integration** — Implemented multiple LLM-based actors for different tasks (matching, research, conversation)
4. **RAQ methodology** — Created testing framework for AI reliability (Repeatable, Auditable, Quality-controlled)
5. **Coordination** — Managed work across multiple AI coding assistants (yes, that's a real thing now)

The tech stack: Python, PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Ollama (local LLMs), HTMX, Cloudflare tunnels.

---

## What It Isn't (Yet)

- **Not launched** — Still in testing with family
- **No users** — Just Gershon, Mysti, and the AI team members
- **No revenue** — Pricing designed (€0/5/10 tiers) but Stripe not connected
- **No company** — This is a personal project, not a GmbH

---

## What This Demonstrates

If the objective is about Gershon's capabilities:

1. **AI application development** — Not just using ChatGPT, but building production systems with multiple specialized AI models
2. **Full-stack engineering** — Backend, frontend, database, deployment, all working together
3. **System design** — Embedding-based matching, tiered memory architecture, modular pipeline design
4. **Self-directed execution** — Went from idea to working product without external team or funding

---

## How to Phrase It (Suggestions)

**Option A (Conservative):**
> "Developed a working prototype of an AI-powered job matching platform as a personal project, demonstrating full-stack development and AI integration capabilities."

**Option B (More Specific):**
> "Built talent.yoga, a job matching system for the German market using embedding-based skill matching and multiple AI agents. Currently in testing phase with ~100K job postings integrated."

**Option C (Capability-Focused):**
> "Designed and implemented a production-grade AI application architecture including data pipelines, LLM integration, and automated quality control — demonstrable skills in the emerging AI engineering discipline."

---

## What I Can't Promise

- That it will launch
- That it will have users
- That it will make money
- That Deutsche Bank will care

What I can say: **It exists, it works, and it took real engineering to build.**

*P.S. If Adele wants to see it, the URL is talent.yoga. Real domain, real site, real matching. Mysti has tested it and likes it. That's the current user base: one person who matters.*
