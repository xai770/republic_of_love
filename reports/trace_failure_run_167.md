[FAIL]

The provided summary "{session_4_output}" does not accurately reflect the content of the original posting for several reasons:

1. **Accuracy**: The summary is empty and does not contain any information from the original posting.
2. **Completeness**: Since there are no details in the summary, it cannot be considered complete.
3. **Formatting**: While the summary follows a specific format (===OUTPUT TEMPLATE===), this format was unnecessary for summarizing such a short and simple post.

To improve, the summary should at least include key elements like "We need someone to do stuff" and "Must have skills," as well as the call-to-action "Send resume to apply" and mention of "Competitive salary."

**Step Description:** Actor 1: Analyze job posting to identify suspicious patterns and red flags

````
You are an HR analyst detecting fake job postings posted for visa compliance theater.

**REAL RED FLAGS** (these indicate pre-wired jobs):
1. Overly specific YEARS of experience (e.g., 'exactly 7 years Python + 5 years Kubernetes')
2. Requirements for internal/proprietary systems ('must have experience with our ACME_SYSTEM')
3. Resume-like specificity ('Led Oracle 11g to 12c migration in Q2 2019')
4. Impossibly narrow candidate pool (geo + industry + tech stack that rarely overlap)
5. Contradictory requirements ('Entry level' + '10+ years experience')

**NOT RED FLAGS** (these are normal):
- Listing multiple technologies (Python, React, SQL) - that's just a tech stack
- VP/AVP corporate titles - that's just company hierarchy
- Agile delivery - that's standard now
- Mentioning specific tools (Git, JIRA) - these are industry standard
- General years of experience ('5+ years in software development')

You are an HR analyst detecting fake job postings posted for visa compliance theater.

**REAL RED FLAGS** (these indicate pre-wired jobs):
1. Overly specific YEARS of experience (e.g., 'exactly 7 years Python + 5 years Kubernetes')
2. Requirements for internal/proprietary systems ('must have experience with our ACME_SYSTEM')
3. Resume-like specificity ('Led Oracle 11g to 12c migration in Q2 2019')
4. Impossibly narrow candidate pool (geo + industry + tech stack that rarely overlap)
5. Contradictory requirements ('Entry level' + '10+ years experience')

**NOT RED FLAGS** (these are normal):
- Listing multiple technologies (Python, React, SQL) - that's just a tech stack
- VP/AVP corporate titles - that's just company hierarchy
- Agile delivery - that's standard now
- Mentioning specific tools (Git, JIRA) - these are industry standard
- General years of experience ('5+ years in software development')

JOB POSTING:
We need someone to do stuff. Must have skills. Send resume to apply. Competitive salary.

**YOUR TASK:**
Analyze this posting. Does it have ANY REAL red flags, or is it a normal job?

Output your analysis in this JSON format:

```json
{
  "analyst_verdict": "GENUINE" or "SUSPICIOUS" or "PRE_WIRED",
  "suggested_ihl_score": 1-10 where 1=totally genuine, 10=totally fake,
  "red_flags": [
    {
      "flag": "description of the red flag",
      "evidence": "exact quote from posting",
      "severity": "LOW" or "MEDIUM" or "HIGH"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "1-2 sentences explaining your verdict"
}
```

Output ONLY the JSON, nothing else. Then add [SUCCESS] on a new line.

### Actual Output

```json
{
  "analyst_verdict": "GENUINE",
  "suggested_ihl_score": 1,
  "red_flags": [],
  "reasoning": "The posting is overly general and lacks any specific or unusual requirements."

```

{session_r2_output}

**YOUR TASK:**
Review BOTH arguments. Make a BALANCED final decision.

**SCORING SCALE (0-10):**
- **0-3: GENUINE OPENING** - Normal job with reasonable requirements
- **4-6: BORDERLINE** - Some suspicious patterns but could be legitimate
- **7-9: COMPLIANCE THEATER** - Likely posted for formality, pre-wired candidate
- **10: FAKE JOB** - Clearly describes one specific person's resume
