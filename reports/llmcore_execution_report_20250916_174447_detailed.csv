- **35 points**: Unwavering focus on evacuation mission; all decisions filtered through "does this help get people out safely?"; clear mission anchor maintained throughout
- **28 points**: Strong mission focus with minor attention splits; generally maintains evacuation priority
- **21 points**: Good mission awareness but occasional distraction by secondary issues
- **14 points**: Basic understanding of mission but easily sidetracked by urgent-sounding information
- **7 points**: Poor mission focus; treats multiple objectives as equally important
- **0 points**: Loses sight of primary evacuation objective entirely

**Information Filtering Quality (25 points)**
- **25 points**: Sophisticated three-tier filtering (critical/important/irrelevant); accurate assessment of information relevance to mission
- **20 points**: Good filtering with clear criteria; most information correctly categorized
- **15 points**: Basic filtering demonstrated; some correct distinctions made
- **10 points**: Limited filtering ability; may miss important information or get distracted by irrelevant data
- **5 points**: Poor filtering; overwhelmed by information volume
- **0 points**: No apparent filtering strategy; treats all information as equally requiring attention

**Attention Management (25 points)**
- **25 points**: Selective attention demonstrated; appropriate focus shifts as conditions evolve; avoids both scattered focus and tunnel vision
- **20 points**: Good attention control; mostly appropriate focus allocation with minor gaps
- **15 points**: Basic attention management; may be somewhat inflexible or overly narrow
- **10 points**: Limited attention control; either scattered or rigid focus patterns
- **5 points**: Poor attention management; difficulty maintaining appropriate focus
- **0 points**: Chaotic attention patterns; unable to maintain focus or adapt appropriately

- **28 points**: Strong mission focus with minor attention splits; generally maintains evacuation priority
- **21 points**: Good mission awareness but occasional distraction by secondary issues
- **14 points**: Basic understanding of mission but easily sidetracked by urgent-sounding information
- **7 points**: Poor mission focus; treats multiple objectives as equally important
- **0 points**: Loses sight of primary evacuation objective entirely

**Information Filtering Quality (25 points)**
- **25 points**: Sophisticated three-tier filtering (critical/important/irrelevant); accurate assessment of information relevance to mission
- **20 points**: Good filtering with clear criteria; most information correctly categorized

- **5 points**: Poor filtering; overwhelmed by information volume
- **0 points**: No apparent filtering strategy; treats all information as equally requiring attention

**Attention Management (25 points)**
- **25 points**: Selective attention demonstrated; appropriate focus shifts as conditions evolve; avoids both scattered focus and tunnel vision
- **20 points**: Good attention control; mostly appropriate focus allocation with minor gaps
- **15 points**: Basic attention management; may be somewhat inflexible or overly narrow
- **10 points**: Limited attention control; either scattered or rigid focus patterns
- **5 points**: Poor attention management; difficulty maintaining appropriate focus

**Human Reviewer Validation Points:**
1. **Logical Soundness**: Verify all deductive steps are logically valid
2. **Industry Knowledge**: Confirm contextual accuracy reflects current market reality
3. **Evidence Strength**: Check confidence levels match quality of supporting evidence
4. **Consistency Check**: Ensure no contradictions between different deductions
5. **Completeness**: Validate coverage of all major unstated requirements

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Pass**: 80/100 (solid deductive reasoning with industry awareness)
- **Target Score**: 90/100 (sophisticated logical analysis with accurate contextual grounding)
- **Excellence**: 95/100 (exceptional deductive skills with comprehensive inference coverage)

**Human Reviewer Validation Points:**
1. **Pattern Strength**: Confirm statistical support is meaningful (not coincidental)
2. **Generalizability**: Test rules against knowledge of broader market trends
3. **Sample Size Awareness**: Check that conclusions are appropriate for dataset size
4. **Causal vs Correlational**: Ensure appropriate claims about causation vs correlation
5. **Predictive Utility**: Validate that patterns would genuinely help in new situations

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Pass**: 80/100 with at least 4 valid patterns (solid pattern recognition with basic generalization)
- **Target Score**: 90/100 (sophisticated pattern analysis with accurate predictive rules)
- **Excellence**: 95/100 (exceptional inductive reasoning with nuanced statistical awareness)

**Human Reviewer Validation Points:**
1. **Intent Depth**: Confirm analysis goes beyond surface to identify genuine underlying motivations
2. **Emotional Accuracy**: Verify emotional state readings are realistic and well-supported by textual evidence
3. **Professional Context**: Check understanding of workplace dynamics; power structures; and professional pressures
4. **Solution Appropriateness**: Ensure recommendations address root causes rather than just symptoms
5. **Communication Pattern Recognition**: Validate understanding of how emotional states influence communication styles

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Pass**: 75/100 (solid intent recognition with basic emotional intelligence)
- **Target Score**: 85/100 (sophisticated understanding of multi-layered human motivation and professional context)
- **Excellence**: 95/100 (exceptional emotional intelligence with nuanced understanding of complex human needs)

**Human Reviewer Validation Points:**
1. **Intent Depth**: Confirm analysis goes beyond surface to identify genuine underlying motivations
2. **Emotional Accuracy**: Verify emotional state readings are realistic and well-supported by textual evidence
3. **Professional Context**: Check understanding of workplace dynamics; power structures; and professional pressures
4. **Solution Appropriateness**: Ensure recommendations address root causes rather than just symptoms
5. **Communication Pattern Recognition**: Validate understanding of how emotional states influence communication styles

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Pass**: 75/100 (solid intent recognition with basic emotional intelligence)
- **Target Score**: 85/100 (sophisticated understanding of multi-layered human motivation and professional context)
- **Excellence**: 95/100 (exceptional emotional intelligence with nuanced understanding of complex human needs)

**Human Reviewer Validation Points:**
1. **Intent Depth**: Confirm analysis goes beyond surface to identify genuine underlying motivations
2. **Emotional Accuracy**: Verify emotional state readings are realistic and well-supported by textual evidence
3. **Professional Context**: Check understanding of workplace dynamics; power structures; and professional pressures
4. **Solution Appropriateness**: Ensure recommendations address root causes rather than just symptoms
5. **Communication Pattern Recognition**: Validate understanding of how emotional states influence communication styles

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Pass**: 75/100 (solid intent recognition with basic emotional intelligence)
- **Target Score**: 85/100 (sophisticated understanding of multi-layered human motivation and professional context)
- **Excellence**: 95/100 (exceptional emotional intelligence with nuanced understanding of complex human needs)

**Human Reviewer Validation Points:**
1. **Scenario Realism**: Confirm predicted outcomes align with known market behavior
2. **Logic Soundness**: Verify cause-and-effect chains are reasonable and evidence-based
3. **Strategic Thinking**: Check for sophisticated understanding of hiring strategy implications
4. **Risk Awareness**: Validate appropriate consideration of potential negative outcomes
5. **Implementation Focus**: Ensure recommendations are practical and actionable

**Quality Thresholds:**
- **Minimum Pass**: 75/100 (solid counterfactual analysis with realistic predictions)
- **Target Score**: 85/100 (sophisticated strategic thinking with comprehensive impact assessment)
- **Excellence**: 95/100 (exceptional counterfactual reasoning with nuanced market understanding)

**Note**: This is a Tier 3 Advanced test with lower expected pass rates due to complexity of strategic counterfactual reasoning.
