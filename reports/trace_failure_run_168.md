### Actual Output

````
[FAIL] 

The AI generated a completely inaccurate summary based on the raw posting.  Here's why:

* **Accuracy:** The summary states "Data Entry Clerk" and lists responsibilities like entering data into spreadsheets, maintaining data integrity, and completing daily updates.  The original posting says nothing about data entry or specific tasks. 
* **Completeness:** The summary includes requirements like typing skills and computer literacy, but these are not mentioned in the original posting.
* **Hallucinations:** The summary fabricates details about a "Company" (ABC Solutions), "Location" (Anytown, USA), and a "Job ID". These are entirely made up.

The AI has hallucinated a job description that does not exist within the provided raw posting.
