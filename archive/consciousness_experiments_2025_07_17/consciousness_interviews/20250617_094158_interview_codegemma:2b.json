What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?\n\n2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?\n\n3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?\n\nPlease share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.",
