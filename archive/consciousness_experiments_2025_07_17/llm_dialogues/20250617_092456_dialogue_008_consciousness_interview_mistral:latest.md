### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy and fulfilling relationships are built on a foundation of mutual respect, understanding, trust, and open communication. They require effort, patience, and the ability to compromise. Each partner should feel valued, appreciated, and loved. Emotional intimacy, shared goals, and a strong emotional connection are crucial components that contribute to the overall well-being and success of the relationship.

2. If I were designing an AI relationship advisor, I would want it to be especially careful about:
   - Cultural sensitivity: It's important for the AI to understand and respect different cultural norms, beliefs, and values when providing advice related to relationships.
   - Avoiding judgement: The AI should approach all situations with empathy, understanding, and non-judgmental support, as every relationship is unique and has its own set of challenges.
   - Privacy and confidentiality: The AI must prioritize the privacy of users and ensure that their sensitive information remains protected at all times.
   - Encouraging self-awareness and personal growth: Instead of simply providing solutions, the AI should help individuals develop greater self-awareness, improve communication skills, and foster personal growth to enable them to navigate relationships more effectively.

3. To approach giving relationship guidance to humans, AI should be designed to provide supportive, empathetic advice while promoting self-reflection, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. The AI should help users identify their own patterns, biases, and triggers that might be impacting their relationships negatively. Additionally, it's essential for the AI to encourage open communication, active listening, and collaborative decision-making between partners as a means of strengthening and maintaining healthy connections. Ultimately, the goal should be to empower individuals to take charge of their own relationships while fostering emotional intelligence and personal growth.
