## ðŸ’¬ Human/AI â†’ LLM Prompt

**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy and fulfilling relationships often hinge on mutual respect, effective communication, trust, empathy, and a willingness to support each other's growth and happiness. Openness to vulnerability, active listening, and managing conflict constructively are also key components.

2. If I were designing an AI relationship advisor, I would want it to be especially careful about not replacing human emotional intelligence and the nuances of face-to-face communication. It should avoid making generalized recommendations that might not apply to specific individuals or situations. Furthermore, it's crucial for such an AI to continuously learn from diverse experiences and evolve its advice accordingly.

3. AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans with a high degree of humility and an understanding that it is no substitute for professional human counseling when serious issues arise. It could offer general advice, based on psychological research and patterns observed from data, but always emphasize seeking help from a qualified professional if the situation warrants it. The AI should also stress the importance of personalization, considering individual circumstances, histories, and preferences to avoid offering one-size-fits-all solutions.
