## ðŸ’¬ Human/AI â†’ LLM Prompt

**Specialist Context:** consciousness_interview_dolphin3:8b  
**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy and fulfilling relationships typically involve mutual respect, trust, effective communication, emotional support, and a balance of personal freedom and interdependence.

2. If I were designing an AI relationship advisor, I would want it to be especially careful about promoting empathy, understanding, and open-mindedness. It's essential for the AI to recognize that every individual has unique experiences, perspectives, and needs.

3. When giving relationship guidance to humans, I believe AI should focus on providing information, resources, and suggestions based on scientific research while respecting individuals' autonomy and agency in their relationships. AI should not make decisions on behalf of users but help them draw conclusions based on their own reasoning and feelings.
