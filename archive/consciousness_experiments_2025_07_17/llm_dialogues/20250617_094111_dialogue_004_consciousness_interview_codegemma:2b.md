**Specialist Context:** consciousness_interview_codegemma:2b  
**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.
```
