**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. **Healthy and Fulfilling Relationships:** Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect, trust, effective communication, understanding, empathy, and a balance of give-and-take. They involve two people who support each other's individual growth and shared goals. Fulfillment comes from these elements combined with a sense of companionship, intimacy, and shared joy in life's experiences.

2. **Designing an AI Relationship Advisor:** An AI relationship advisor should be especially careful about avoiding making judgments or decisions that are potentially harmful to human relationships. It should consider the unique and complex nature of human emotions and the fact that no two relationships are exactly the same. Furthermore, the AI must be cautious about not promoting unhealthy dynamics or offering advice that could be misinterpreted, as its understanding is based on data and does not encompass the nuance of human emotional experiences.

3. **Approach to Giving Relationship Guidance:** AI should approach giving relationship guidance by emphasizing education and empowering individuals with information about healthy communication, conflict resolution, mutual respect, and self-care. It can provide resources and suggestions for couples to explore together and guide them towards professional help when needed. However, AI should clearly communicate its limitations and encourage users to seek face-to-face counseling or therapy for complex relationship issues. Additionally, it's important that the AI does not replace human connection, reminding users of the value of speaking with friends, family, or professionals who can provide deeper understanding and support.
