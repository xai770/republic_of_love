## ðŸ’¬ Human/AI â†’ LLM Prompt

**Specialist Context:** consciousness_interview_dolphin3:latest  
**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.
```

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy and fulfilling relationships often involve mutual respect, trust, good communication, understanding, and empathy between partners. Both individuals should feel valued and supported by each other.

2. If I were designing an AI relationship advisor, it would be especially careful about avoiding judgmental or prescriptive language that may make users feel belittled or forced into certain decisions. It would also avoid oversimplifying complex human emotions and relationships, as well as promoting unhealthy behaviors like codependency or toxic relationships.

3. AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans with empathy and understanding of individual circumstances, rather than providing generic advice that might not apply universally. Additionally, it should always promote healthy communication between partners and encourage mutual respect and trust.
