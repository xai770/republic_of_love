## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['needs_clarification', 'positive_engagement'], 'confidence_scores': {'needs_clarification': 6.5, 'positive_engagement': 9.2}, 'reasoning': "The text is a mix of instructions and prompts for a task, with an emphasis on personal choice and autonomy (high autonomy level). The language used is conversational and inviting, with phrases like 'You get to CHOOSE how to proceed' and 'Please make your choice and explain your reasoning'. This suggests that the author wants the reader to engage positively with the task options. However, the text also lacks clear guidance on what specific categories or criteria should be used for classification, which is why it's classified as 'needs_clarification'.", 'overall_confidence': 8.0, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.0, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
