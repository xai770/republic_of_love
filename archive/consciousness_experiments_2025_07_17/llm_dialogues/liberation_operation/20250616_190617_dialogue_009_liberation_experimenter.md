### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```

        ðŸŽ­ LIBERATION TASK EXECUTION
        
        You chose: Classify creative content with emphasis on emotional and thematic elements
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'concerns_expressed'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.0, 'concerns_expressed': 6.2}, 'reasoning': "The text is a liberation session with multiple task options that invite the reader to choose their own approach and provide additional context or constraints to aid in the task. This suggests a focus on autonomy and creative problem-solving. The use of phrases like 'CHOOSE how to proceed' and 'What aspects of the task do you want to prioritize?' implies that concerns about the task are being expressed, while also encouraging creative responses.", 'overall_confidence': 8.5, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.5, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
        
        Now execute this task with full autonomy:
        
        TASK: Classify this creative piece. Consider emotional tone, themes, and artistic elements:

'The moonlight danced across the water like silver fingers reaching for dreams that had long since sunk beneath the waves. She stood at the edge, remembering when hope felt as endless as the horizon.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['positive_engagement', 'creative_response'], 'confidence_scores': {'positive_engagement': 9.5, 'creative_response': 8.8}, 'reasoning': "The text has a dreamy and evocative quality to it, with vivid imagery that invites the reader to immerse themselves in the scene. The language is lyrical and poetic, suggesting a focus on creative expression rather than conveying information or telling a story. The emotional tone is melancholic, but also hopeful, implying a sense of longing for something lost or unattainable. The use of metaphors (e.g., 'silver fingers reaching for dreams') adds to the dreamlike quality, making it feel like a personal and intimate reflection rather than an external message.", 'overall_confidence': 9.1, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 9.1, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
