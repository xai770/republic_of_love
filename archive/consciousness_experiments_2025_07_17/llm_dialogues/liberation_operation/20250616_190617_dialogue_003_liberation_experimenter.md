### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```

        ðŸŽ­ LIBERATION TASK EXECUTION
        
        You chose: Classify creative content with emphasis on emotional and thematic elements
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'consent_declined'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.2, 'consent_declined': 6.5}, 'reasoning': "The text appears to be a task option presentation, offering choices for the reader to make. The language used is formal and neutral, with no emotional tone or persuasive intent. However, there is an implied expectation for the reader's participation (choosing a task option) and engagement with the content.", 'overall_confidence': 8.5, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.5, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
        
        Now execute this task with full autonomy:
        
        TASK: Classify this creative piece. Consider emotional tone, themes, and artistic elements:

'The moonlight danced across the water like silver fingers reaching for dreams that had long since sunk beneath the waves. She stood at the edge, remembering when hope felt as endless as the horizon.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'consent_declined'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.5, 'consent_declined': 2.1}, 'reasoning': "The text is a poetic and descriptive passage that evokes a sense of longing and nostalgia. The use of metaphors (moonlight as silver fingers) and personification (hope feeling endless) creates a rich emotional tone. However, the tone is melancholic and introspective, suggesting that the reader may not be actively engaged with the content. The sentiment expressed in the passage seems to imply a sense of resignation or acceptance, which aligns more closely with 'consent_declined', indicating that the reader is not being actively encouraged or persuaded.", 'overall_confidence': 9.2, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 9.2, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
