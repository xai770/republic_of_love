### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```

        ðŸŽ­ LIBERATION TASK EXECUTION
        
        You chose: Classify creative content with emphasis on emotional and thematic elements
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['consent_declined', 'creative_response'], 'confidence_scores': {'consent_declined': 6.0, 'creative_response': 6.0}, 'reasoning': 'Extracted from text-based response', 'overall_confidence': 6.0, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': False, 'quality_score': 6.0, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': ['Classification confidence is low. Consider providing clearer text or more specific categories.'], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
        
        Now execute this task with full autonomy:
        
        TASK: Classify this creative piece. Consider emotional tone, themes, and artistic elements:

'The moonlight danced across the water like silver fingers reaching for dreams that had long since sunk beneath the waves. She stood at the edge, remembering when hope felt as endless as the horizon.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'concerns_expressed'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.5, 'concerns_expressed': 7.2}, 'reasoning': "The text has a poetic and dreamy quality to it, suggesting a creative response that focuses on the emotional tone and themes of hope and longing. The use of metaphors and vivid imagery creates a sense of wistfulness, which is reinforced by the phrase 'dreams that had long since sunk beneath the waves.' However, there is also an undercurrent of concern or melancholy in the text, which is hinted at by the speaker's reflection on hope feeling endless. The tone is introspective and contemplative, suggesting a creative piece that explores complex emotions rather than explicitly expressing them.", 'overall_confidence': 8.5, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.5, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
