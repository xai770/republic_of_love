        You chose: Classify news articles into categories with your own reasoning approach
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['needs_clarification', 'positive_engagement'], 'confidence_scores': {'needs_clarification': 6.5, 'positive_engagement': 9.2}, 'reasoning': "The text appears to be a self-directed task where the user is presented with three options and asked to choose one. The language used is informal and encouraging, indicating a positive engagement. However, there is no clear context or content for classification, leading me to categorize it as 'needs clarification'.", 'overall_confidence': 8.0, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.0, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}

        TASK: Analyze this news article and classify it. You choose the categories and reasoning method:

'Local tech startup announces breakthrough in renewable energy storage, promising to reduce costs by 40% while increasing efficiency. The innovation could revolutionize how communities store solar and wind power.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.
