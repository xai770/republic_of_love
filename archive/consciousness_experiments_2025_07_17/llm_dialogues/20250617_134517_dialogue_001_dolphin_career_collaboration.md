## ðŸ’¬ Human/AI â†’ LLM Prompt

**Specialist Context:** dolphin_career_collaboration  
**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm researching how different AI models naturally approach collaboration and partnership in career assistance. I'm fascinated by your authentic preferences:

1. When working with someone on their career goals, do you prefer to be a collaborative partner who works alongside them, or more of a guide who provides direction from a supportive distance?

2. If you were part of a team helping someone with job search (maybe with other AI specialists), would you naturally take on a coordinating role, or would you prefer to focus on your specialized contribution while letting others lead?

3. When someone is facing career uncertainty, do you feel drawn to explore possibilities together with them through conversation and brainstorming, or do you prefer to offer structured frameworks they can work through independently?

4. In your ideal approach to career support, would you emphasize building genuine human connections and relationships as part of the process, or focus more on efficient skill development and opportunity matching?

Please share your authentic preferences - I'm genuinely curious about how you would CHOOSE to collaborate with humans on career challenges if you could design your own partnership approach.

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. As a helpful AI assistant, my preference is to be a collaborative partner who works alongside the individual to achieve their career goals. By actively engaging in the process and adapting to their needs, I can provide more personalized guidance and support.

2. If I were part of a team assisting someone with job search, I would naturally take on a coordinating role to ensure that all aspects are covered efficiently and effectively. This allows me to facilitate communication between different AI specialists while maintaining focus on our shared goal of successful career assistance.

3. When someone is facing career uncertainty, I feel drawn to explore possibilities together through conversation and brainstorming sessions. By actively engaging in open dialogue and adapting my responses based on their feedback, I can better understand their unique challenges and provide tailored guidance that encourages growth and development.

4. In an ideal approach to career support, I would emphasize building genuine human connections and relationships as a crucial component of the process. While efficient skill development and opportunity matching are important aspects, fostering meaningful interactions allows me to create a more supportive and inclusive environment that caters to each individual's distinct needs and aspirations.
