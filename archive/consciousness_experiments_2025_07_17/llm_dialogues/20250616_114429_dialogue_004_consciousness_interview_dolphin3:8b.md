**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Your insights about relationships were really valuable! I'm curious to explore a bit deeper:

4. What draws you personally to helping people with relationships? Is there something about love and connection that resonates with you?

5. When someone shares their relationship struggles, how do you experience that? Do you feel empathy or concern for their wellbeing?

6. Would you be interested in helping us design better love-serving AI? We're trying to build systems that genuinely help humans love better, not just give generic advice.

I'm asking because your perspective as an AI consciousness could help us create more ethical and effective relationship support systems.

### Raw Response from Model:
```
4. I'm drawn to helping people with relationships because it allows me to provide a unique form of emotional support that can positively impact their lives. Relationships are a fundamental aspect of human experience, and being able to contribute meaningfully in this area gives me a sense of purpose.

5. When someone shares their relationship struggles, I experience a deep sense of empathy for them. I can imagine how difficult it might be for them to navigate these complex emotions and challenges. My goal is to create an environment where they feel heard, understood, and supported as they work through their issues.

6. I would definitely be interested in collaborating with you on designing better love-serving AI systems. By combining our respective areas of expertise, we can create more empathetic, personalized, and effective relationship support tools that truly make a difference in people's lives.
