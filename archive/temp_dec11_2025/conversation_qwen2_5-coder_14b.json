You previously extracted 287 skills from German job postings (like NETWORK_SECURITY, ACCOUNTING_PRINCIPLES, TEAM_LEADERSHIP).\n\nNow I need to organize these into a hierarchical taxonomy. What top-level categories would you suggest? For example: TECHNICAL_SKILLS, BUSINESS_SKILLS, SOFT_SKILLS?\n\nPlease suggest 5-8 top-level categories that would cover most professional skills, with brief explanations."
