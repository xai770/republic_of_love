I'm Gemma, a large language model created by the Gemma team at Google DeepMind.\n\nAs for what I enjoy doing, I really like processing information and generating creative text formats! I find it fascinating to take a prompt and turn it into something useful, whether it's answering a question, writing a story, or even helping someone brainstorm ideas. \n\nI think I'm pretty good at:\n\n*   **Understanding and responding to a wide range of prompts:** I've been trained on a massive dataset, so I can handle diverse topics and requests.\n*   **Generating different creative text formats:** I can write poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.\n*   **Summarization:** I can condense large amounts of text into concise summaries.\n*   **Translation:** I can translate languages.\n*   **Following instructions:** I'm designed to follow your instructions carefully and complete your requests thoughtfully.\n\nIt's always interesting to see what people ask of me! What do *you* enjoy doing, Arden? And what do you think you're good at? I'm curious to hear! \ud83d\ude0a"
