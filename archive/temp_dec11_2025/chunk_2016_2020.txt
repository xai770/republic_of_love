Thinking...
First, I'm considering the user's query about analyzing my experience as a self-employed individual from 2016 to 2020. They want me to break it down into stakeholder levels, functions involved, required skills, and career progression insights. Since they mentioned "you," it seems like this is framed as if I'm reflecting on someone's own career, but the user might be referring to themselves or a hypothetical scenario.

The query says "Self-Employed" for the organization, so I need to approach this from that perspective. The key part is developing an analysis framework for structured text documents, focusing on tracking document changes and managing issues in negotiations with large vendors, using ML for ontology generation and matching between docs.<br><br>

For stakeholder levels, as a self-employed professional, they'd deal with clients directly since there's no internal team. I should list the main stakeholders: clients (the decision-makers who hired them), probably legal teams if contracts are involved, maybe procurement or business departments for content needs.

Moving to functions involved—this is where I need to think about which parts of an organization would be affected by this work. Legal might handle contract reviews, but as a consultant, it's more about providing tools that help various departments like finance and operations manage their tasks efficiently.<br><br>

Organizational skills required: stakeholder management is key because they're dealing with different people who need the tool for various reasons. Cross-functional collaboration means working across areas even though there's no formal team—maybe relying on networked resources or external experts. Influence without authority comes from being a freelancer, so they have to persuade clients and colleagues using expertise.<br><br>

Change management is about implementing the tool effectively in client projects, not necessarily internal changes. Negotiation might be part of contract discussions with vendors themselves, but since I'm self-employed, it's more about negotiating terms or scope with clients. Political savvy helps navigate client dynamics to build trust and influence outcomes without formal power.<br><br>

Career progression insights: This period shows growth from individual contributor to a role that involves higher-level thinking, like strategy and implementation across different projects. Scope-wise, they're moving beyond single tasks to manage multiple aspects, influencing clients directly rather than through hierarchy.

Now, I should structure the response clearly with sections for each part of the query. Make it helpful and thorough by providing examples or reasoning where possible.<br><br>

I'll start with stakeholder levels. List out the main ones: clients/decision-makers are top-level stakeholders, legal teams might be involved if there's compliance or contract review risk, procurement departments could handle vendor interactions, finance for budgeting tools, operations for business process needs, and end users like analysts who use the tool daily.<br><br>

For functions involved, I need to specify why each is relevant. Legal uses it for document analysis, but as a self-employed person, they're not directly part of those functions; instead, their work supports them by addressing challenges in these areas.

Organizational skills: Emphasize how being self-employed requires soft skills like stakeholder management and collaboration through external networks. Influence without authority is crucial because credibility relies on expertise rather than position. Change management here means guiding clients to use the tool effectively.<br><br>

Career progression: This shows moving from tactical tasks (building models) to strategic ones (understanding business needs). Scope increases, as they handle multiple projects and stakeholders.

I need to ensure my response is professional, logical, and directly addresses all parts of the query. Since this is hypothetical, I'll use first-person perspective but frame it as an analysis based on typical experiences.<br><br>

Finally, structure the answer with headings for clarity.
...done thinking.

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how I would approach analyzing your career period (2016-2020) as a self-employed professional working on developing an analysis framework for structured text documents in vendor negotiations and document matching. As a DeepSeek assistant, I'll provide a detailed response based on common patterns seen in such roles.

**Stakeholder Levels:**

As a self-employed individual during this period, your primary stakeholders would be clients or their key personnel who hired you to develop the framework. Since there's no direct reporting structure, stakeholder engagement relies heavily on understanding client needs and building relationships with decision-makers at different levels:

- **Clients/Decision-Makers**: You’d interact directly with individuals responsible for procurement, legal contracts, compliance, operations, or project management in organizations that require document analysis tools.
  
- **Legal Teams (if applicable)**: Legal departments often handle contract negotiations. They might be involved if the framework addresses legal risks like non-compliance clauses or contractual inconsistencies. For example:
  - If you're helping a law firm analyze contracts for compliance issues, they’d review your findings to ensure alignment with regulatory standards.
  - Your tool could track changes and flag potential breaches or ambiguous terms in negotiations.

- **Procurement/Supply Chain Teams**: They often drive vendor negotiation projects because these processes are central to business operations. You might work closely with procurement managers to understand their workflows, document tracking needs, and pain points during deals.

- **Finance/CFO Departments (if budgeting is involved)**: If the framework helps model cost implications of contract terms or save on legal fees through automation, finance teams could be stakeholders in assessing ROI and tool funding.

- **Operations/Compliance Teams**: These might use your framework to manage internal business processes. For instance, operations could input data into the tool for analysis, while compliance uses it to ensure contractual adherence across multiple documents.
  
- **End Users (e.g., Contract Analysts or Operations Staff)**: They’re responsible for implementing and using the tool daily. Their feedback drives usability improvements.

**Functions Involved:**

This period involves working with various organizational functions through client interactions, not as direct involvement but through supporting their needs:

| Function        | Why Involved |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Legal           | The framework helps clients analyze vendor contracts for compliance and risk management. If legal risks are part of the problem (e.g., tracking contractual obligations), they may review outputs or provide input during development. |
| Procurement     | They drive the need for negotiation tools, ensuring that your solution integrates with their processes (e.g., RFx proposals). |
| Finance         | Involved in budgeting and funding the project, especially if cost-saving is a key outcome of the tool you built. |
| Operations       | Need to track vendor interactions or manage business operations tied to document analysis, such as supply chain agreements or logistics contracts. |
| Compliance       | Ensure that all documents adhere to regulations (e.g., GDPR for data-sharing clauses in contracts). |

**Organizational Skills Required:**

As a self-employed professional, you'd need:

- **Stakeholder Management**: You’d manage relationships with clients and their internal teams directly, ensuring buy-in by demonstrating value through targeted demos or reports. For example, showing how the tool reduces negotiation risks for legal or finance could build trust.

- **Cross-functional Collaboration (via external networks)**: Since there's no team structure, you'd collaborate with experts in other fields—legal professionals, data scientists, and operations managers—through networking to inform your work effectively.

- **Influence Without Authority**: You’d rely on this skill heavily. For instance, persuading a client’s legal team (who aren't paying you directly) to adopt your framework requires building trust through expertise rather than hierarchical command.

- **Change Management**: You'd help clients transition from manual document analysis to using the tool by providing training and guiding implementation during projects.

- **Negotiation Skills**: As part of vendor negotiations, your work might involve understanding negotiation terms or even discussing changes with vendors themselves. But since you're self-employed, this is more about facilitating client-side processes rather than direct deal-making.

- **Political Savvy**: Dealing with different departments in various clients—like finance wanting quick ROI and legal needing detailed risk analysis—requires balancing priorities and navigating unspoken tensions to deliver a solution that satisfies all parties or at least the primary user.

**Career Progression Insights:**

This period reflects significant growth from an individual contributor to a role with broader impact:

- **Leadership Level**: You moved beyond coding models for personal projects into managing client-facing tasks, demonstrating leadership through project management and stakeholder engagement. This isn't team leadership but rather professional leadership—leading engagements independently.

- **Scope of Influence**: Your work extends across multiple clients (if you're handling several) or within a single organization's different functions during one project. For example:
  - If working with one client, your influence is departmental-level.
  - With multiple projects, it becomes more strategic and cross-client focused.

- **Strategic vs Tactical Work**: You’re shifting from tactical development (e.g., building the ML models) to strategic implementation and business case justification. This period shows an understanding of how technical solutions fit into larger organizational processes—like reducing negotiation risks or improving compliance outcomes—which is a sign of maturing expertise.

---

In summary, this career period highlights your transition toward client-centric problem-solving while retaining specialized technical skills in machine learning and document analysis. It’s a step up from individual contribution to independent project delivery, building both domain credibility and soft skills necessary for higher roles like senior consultant or product manager later on.
