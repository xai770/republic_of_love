We have 287 professional skills extracted from job postings (like Network Security, Financial Modeling, Strategic Planning, etc.) that need to be organized into a hierarchical structure.\n\nOur goal: Build a multi-level taxonomy where recruiters can browse skills by category and match candidates to jobs based on skill hierarchies.\n\nWhat established skill taxonomy standards are you familiar with? (Examples: O*NET, ESCO, LinkedIn Skills Graph, etc.)\n\nPlease list 3-5 standards you know about."

    "content": "Here are five widely recognized skill taxonomy standards that you might find useful for your job-candidate matching system:\n\n1. **O*NET** (Occupational Information Network): Developed by the U.S. Department of Labor, O*NET is one of the most comprehensive databases of occupational information in the United States. It includes a detailed skills hierarchy with over 35,000 skills organized into six levels: Core Knowledge, Work Activities, Occupational Specialty Skills, Tools Used, Technology Skills, and Functional Areas. (https://www.onetonline.org/taxonomy/)\n\n2. **ESCO** (European Skills/Competences, qualifications and Occupations): ESCO is a multilingual classification system covering all EU countries and Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. It consists of around 15,000 units of competence, organized into four levels: Units of competence, Broad occupational categories, Occupational categories, and Unit groups. (https://www.eskillsmonitor.eu/esco/)\n\n3. **LinkedIn Skills Graph**: LinkedIn's Skills Graph is a large-scale skill taxonomy built from the data of over 740 million members. It consists of around 50,000 skills organized into clusters based on relatedness. While not as hierarchical as other standards, it provides valuable insights into how skills are interconnected within LinkedIn's professional network. (https://www.linkedin.com/skills/)\n\n4. **UNESCO International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)**: Although primarily focused on education levels and programs, ISCED also includes a skill framework with over 150 skills organized into three levels: Field-specific skills, General skills, and Personal qualities. This taxonomy can be useful for mapping educational qualifications to professional skills. (https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000276997)\n\n5. **International Labour Organization's International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)**: ISCO is an international standard for classifying occupational groups based on job tasks, duties, and skills required. It consists of four levels: Major groups, Sub-major groups, Units groups, and Sub-unit groups. While not as detailed in terms of individual skills as some other taxonomies, ISCO provides a high-level structure that can be useful for organizing your skill hierarchy into broader occupational categories. (https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/)\n\nThese standards provide well-established structures and frameworks that you can use to organize the 287 professional skills extracted from job postings in your system. They also offer additional context and insights that may help refine your taxonomy and improve match quality."

    "content": "Based on your goal to build a multi-level taxonomy for job-candidate matching and considering the established skill taxonomy standards, I would recommend adopting **O*NET** as your foundation. Here's why it's the best fit:\n\n1. **Comprehensiveness**: O*NET is one of the most comprehensive databases of occupational information in the United States, covering over 970 occupations with detailed skills hierarchies.\n2. **Hierarchical structure**: O*NET organizes its skills into a well-defined hierarchy with six levels, making it ideal for creating a multi-level taxonomy that recruiters can browse by category and match candidates based on skill hierarchies.\n3. **Interconnectivity**: O*NET's skills are interconnected through networks of related skills, allowing you to capture semantic relationships between the 287 professional skills extracted from job postings.\n\n**Top-level categories in O*NET**:\n\nO*NET organizes its skills into six top-level categories:\n\n1. Core Knowledge: Basic knowledge required for a particular job.\n2. Work Activities: The activities involved in performing a job, such as handling and moving objects or communicating with others.\n3. Occupational Specialty Skills: Skills specific to a particular occupation, like analyzing data or designing products.\n4. Tools Used: Equipment and tools used to perform a job, such as software applications or measurement instruments.\n5. Technology Skills: Knowledge of specific technologies required for a job, like programming languages or operating systems.\n6. Functional Areas: Broad areas of knowledge related to an occupation, like administration and management or sales.\n\n**Hierarchy depth**:\n\nO*NET's skill hierarchy typically goes six levels deep:\n\n1. Top-level category (e.g., Core Knowledge)\n2. Mid-level categories (e.g., Knowledge of English Language)\n3. Sub-categories (e.g., Reading Comprehension)\n4. Specific skills (e.g., Understanding Written Reports)\n\nBy adopting O*NET as your foundation, you'll have access to a well-structured and comprehensive skill taxonomy that will help improve the quality of job matches in your system. Additionally, using O*NET will provide your users with a familiar reference point since it's widely recognized and used by employers, educators, and individuals throughout the United States."
