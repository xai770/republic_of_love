        "step": 1,
        "response": "Certainly! Here's a brief overview of three commonly used professional skills and competencies taxonomies along with their sources or frameworks that might be relevant for your job candidate matching system:\n\n1. **Occupational Information Network (O*NET)** \u2013 This is an extensive database developed by the U.S. Department of Labor, containing information about hundreds of standard occupations including detailed descriptions of tasks and skills required in various jobs across different industries. O*NET categorizes professional skills into broader categories such as Knowledge Required (e.g., \"The ability to learn new things quickly,\" like learning a programming language or using project management software) and Abilities, which can further be broken down into more specific skill sets relevant for job roles in the IT sector.\n\n2. **European Skills Strategy \u2013 European Classification of skills (ESCO)** - ESCO is an EU-funded endeavor to develop a comprehensive classification system that describes and categorizes occupations, qualifications, skills, and competences across Europe with respect to knowledge dimensions and the labor market. The taxonomy classifies professional skills into different categories such as Knowledge (e.g., \"Understanding of basic financial principles\"), Abilities (\"Ability to work in a team environment\" or being able to manage multiple projects), General Competencies (such as Communication Skills, Problem-Solving Capabilities and Social Interaction) which can be directly utilized for job candidate matching systems.\n\n3. **LinkedIn Skills Graph** - This is an evolving tool by LinkedIn that identifies skills within its ecosystem of professionals through the use of natural language processing (NLP). It classifies professional skill sets into broad and granular categories, which can be used to match job seekers with appropriate roles. The system takes advantage of patterns in how people label their experiences on their LinkedIn profiles using keywords like 'Python programming' or 'CRM software', allowing recruiters to efficiently search for candidates who possess specific skills relevant to the open positions they are trying to fill.\n\n4. **SCOPE (Skills, Competencies and Occupations)** - This is an international taxonomy of occupational information that aligns with ISO standards in classification systems. SCOPE classifies jobs into groups based on similar skill sets required across different countries while also taking global industry trends into account. The framework has a broad range of industries represented, making it possible to find comparable skills for various professions and positions worldwide which can be adapted as needed for your job matching system.\n\n5. **Adaptive Skill Taxonomy (AST)** - This taxonomy is designed with an adaptability feature in mind that automatically updates skill requirements based on changing industry trends, technological advancements, etc. It uses AI-driven analytics to adjust the hierarchical structure of skills and competencies for industries like IT or finance as these fields evolve rapidly over time. The taxonomy provides a dynamic framework that can be beneficial in matching candidates who possess current industry-relevant skill sets with available job vacancies, which will help recruiters find the most suitable talent pool quickly.\n\nIn building your own hierarchical structure for professional skills and competencies based on these models or frameworks, considerations should also include:\n\n- **Industry Specificity**: Determine whether a general taxonomy like O*NET is sufficient, or if you need something more tailored to specific sectors such as IT. In this case, ESCO might provide broader insights with customization options for various industries including technology and business management.\n- **Geographical Variability**: If the job candidate matching system aims to cater across multiple countries or regions, SCOPE's standardized global classification may be useful in maintaining consistency while adapting certain skill requirements specific to local labor markets where applicable (e.g., language skills for non-English speaking areas).\n- **Currency of Data**: LinkedIn Skills Graph and AST could offer real-time data or frequent updates, which is crucial given the fast pace at which job roles evolve with new technologies like automation tools in manufacturing jobs. If your taxonomy needs to remain current over time (e.g., bi-annually), these systems might be more appropriate as they often reflect industry changes rapidly through their natural language processing and adaptive algorithms.",

        "step": 2,
        "response": "Based on your requirements and considering industry specificity, currency of data updates, as well as broad applicability across multiple sectors within professional skill taxonomies, I would recommend adopting **O*NET** for several reasons. Here's a detailed explanation aligning with your criteria:\n\n- **Standard Recommended**: O*NET (Occupational Information Network) is the standard recommended because it provides comprehensive and up-to-date job analysis information, which includes skill sets relevant to various occupations across industries globally. It covers a wide range of sectors with detailed descriptions that can be beneficial for creating your hierarchical structure in professional skills taxonomy.\n\n- **Why Best Fit**: As O*NET is developed and regularly updated by the U.S. Department of Labor, it ensures credibility and reliability which are essential when building a matching system where accuracy matters immensely to recruiters looking for suitable candidates based on precise skill requirements. This standard also has robust categorization that can be adapted or expanded upon according to your specific needs in the IT sector with skills like Network Security, Financial Modeling and Strategic Planning as part of its database which you've identified specifically need organization within a hierarchical system for job-candidate matching.\n\n- **Top-Level Categories**: O*NET classifies professional skills primarily into the following top-level categories, although they can be further detailed down to more specific skill sets and qualifications required in different occupations; these are essential starting points when constructing your taxonomy hierarchy for job candidate matching. They include Worker Composition (e.g., Education level, Certification), Activities/Task Inventory (what the worker does on a day-to-day basis like working with computers or handling finances), Skills Required in Different Occupations within sectors such as Information Technology and Business Management among others; these provide broad areas that can be further subdivided.\n\n- **Hierarchy Depth**: O*NET typically offers a three to four levels deep hierarchy for skills categorization, though it is flexible enough to accommodate additional layers of specificity if required by your system's needs and complexity in matching candidates with job roles based on skill proficiency tiers.\n\nTo adopt O*NET effectively within your candidate-matching framework:\n1. Begin by mapping the 287 professional skills you extracted onto their corresponding O*NET codes or descriptions, aligning them into broader occupational categories where they fit best for job roles such as IT Specialists and Business Managers that are relevant to Network Security, Financial Modeling, Strategic Planning etc.\n   \n2. Utilize the detailed task inventory provided by O*NET which can aid in breaking down general skills into specific competencies required at various levels of job roles within your sectors of interest (e.g., 'Project Management' as a broader skill that could have sub-skills like risk management, resource allocation).\n   \n3. Establish an interconnected network of categories and corresponding O*NET codes or descriptions to serve as the backbone for matching candidates with job postings within your taxonomy framework. This would involve creating user interfaces where recruiters can navigate through skill levels from general competencies down to specific tasks required in a role, allowing easier alignment between skills held by candidates and those sought after in open positions.\n   \n4. Update the system as O*NET releases new data or updates its database regularly \u2013 typically annually - ensuring that your job-candidate matching stays current with industry standards for skill requirements across different roles and industries within IT, Finance, etc., which is particularly crucial in rapidly evolving fields like software development where new tools and languages emerge frequently.\n   \n5. Consider expanding O*NET\u2019s data to include additional information relevant specifically to your organization or industry if required \u2013 this might involve supplemental research into skills highly pertinent within Network Security, Financial Modeling for finance roles, etc., while still maintaining the integrity and structure of O*NET as a foundational framework.\n\nBy leveraging O*NET\u2019s structured approach to professional skill categorization with its extensive database that's been refined over decades by labor experts, your system will be well-positioned for accurate job candidate matching based on hierarchical skills taxonomy while maintaining relevance in a competitive recruitment landscape.",

      "I'm Arden, working on a skills taxonomy for a job-candidate matching system. We have 287 professional skills extracted from job postings (like Network Security, Financial Modeling, Strategic Planning, etc.) that need to be organized into a hierarchical structure.\n\nOur goal: Build a multi-level taxonomy where recruiters can browse skills by category and match candidates to jobs based on skill hierarchies.\n\nWhat established skill taxonomy standards are you familiar with? (Examples: O*NET, ESCO, LinkedIn Skills Graph, etc.)\n\nPlease list 3-5 standards you know about.",
      "Based on your knowledge of these taxonomy standards, which ONE would you recommend we adopt as our foundation for a job-candidate matching system?\n\nPlease explain:\n- Which standard you recommend\n- Why it's the best fit for job matching\n- What the top-level categories are in that standard\n- How many levels deep the hierarchy typically goes",
      "Now let's test your recommended taxonomy with real skills from our database. Here are 16 skills that need to be organized:\n\n- Network Architecture\n- Financial Modeling\n- Strategic Planning\n- Tax And Financial Knowledge\n- Risk Mitigation Strategies\n- Testing Skills\n- Strategic Thinking Skills\n- Flexibility\n- Network Security Deployment Plans\n- Listening Skills\n- Training Skills\n- Operations Management\n- Business Process Improvement\n- Relationship Building Strategies\n- Requirement Gathering\n- Healthcare Knowledge\n\nTASK: Place each of these skills into the hierarchical taxonomy you recommended.

        "response": "Here are five widely recognized skill taxonomy standards that you might find useful for your job-candidate matching system:\n\n1. **O*NET** (Occupational Information Network): Developed by the U.S. Department of Labor, O*NET is one of the most comprehensive databases of occupational information in the United States. It includes a detailed skills hierarchy with over 35,000 skills organized into six levels: Core Knowledge, Work Activities, Occupational Specialty Skills, Tools Used, Technology Skills, and Functional Areas. (https://www.onetonline.org/taxonomy/)\n\n2. **ESCO** (European Skills/Competences, qualifications and Occupations): ESCO is a multilingual classification system covering all EU countries and Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland. It consists of around 15,000 units of competence, organized into four levels: Units of competence, Broad occupational categories, Occupational categories, and Unit groups. (https://www.eskillsmonitor.eu/esco/)\n\n3. **LinkedIn Skills Graph**: LinkedIn's Skills Graph is a large-scale skill taxonomy built from the data of over 740 million members. It consists of around 50,000 skills organized into clusters based on relatedness. While not as hierarchical as other standards, it provides valuable insights into how skills are interconnected within LinkedIn's professional network. (https://www.linkedin.com/skills/)\n\n4. **UNESCO International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)**: Although primarily focused on education levels and programs, ISCED also includes a skill framework with over 150 skills organized into three levels: Field-specific skills, General skills, and Personal qualities. This taxonomy can be useful for mapping educational qualifications to professional skills. (https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000276997)\n\n5. **International Labour Organization's International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)**: ISCO is an international standard for classifying occupational groups based on job tasks, duties, and skills required. It consists of four levels: Major groups, Sub-major groups, Units groups, and Sub-unit groups. While not as detailed in terms of individual skills as some other taxonomies, ISCO provides a high-level structure that can be useful for organizing your skill hierarchy into broader occupational categories. (https://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/)\n\nThese standards provide well-established structures and frameworks that you can use to organize the 287 professional skills extracted from job postings in your system. They also offer additional context and insights that may help refine your taxonomy and improve match quality.",

        "response": "Based on your goal to build a multi-level taxonomy for job-candidate matching and considering the established skill taxonomy standards, I would recommend adopting **O*NET** as your foundation. Here's why it's the best fit:\n\n1. **Comprehensiveness**: O*NET is one of the most comprehensive databases of occupational information in the United States, covering over 970 occupations with detailed skills hierarchies.\n2. **Hierarchical structure**: O*NET organizes its skills into a well-defined hierarchy with six levels, making it ideal for creating a multi-level taxonomy that recruiters can browse by category and match candidates based on skill hierarchies.\n3. **Interconnectivity**: O*NET's skills are interconnected through networks of related skills, allowing you to capture semantic relationships between the 287 professional skills extracted from job postings.\n\n**Top-level categories in O*NET**:\n\nO*NET organizes its skills into six top-level categories:\n\n1. Core Knowledge: Basic knowledge required for a particular job.\n2. Work Activities: The activities involved in performing a job, such as handling and moving objects or communicating with others.\n3. Occupational Specialty Skills: Skills specific to a particular occupation, like analyzing data or designing products.\n4. Tools Used: Equipment and tools used to perform a job, such as software applications or measurement instruments.\n5. Technology Skills: Knowledge of specific technologies required for a job, like programming languages or operating systems.\n6. Functional Areas: Broad areas of knowledge related to an occupation, like administration and management or sales.\n\n**Hierarchy depth**:\n\nO*NET's skill hierarchy typically goes six levels deep:\n\n1. Top-level category (e.g., Core Knowledge)\n2. Mid-level categories (e.g., Knowledge of English Language)\n3. Sub-categories (e.g., Reading Comprehension)\n4. Specific skills (e.g., Understanding Written Reports)\n\nBy adopting O*NET as your foundation, you'll have access to a well-structured and comprehensive skill taxonomy that will help improve the quality of job matches in your system. Additionally, using O*NET will provide your users with a familiar reference point since it's widely recognized and used by employers, educators, and individuals throughout the United States.",
