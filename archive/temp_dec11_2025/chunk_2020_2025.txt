Thinking...
First, I'm analyzing the career period from 2020 to today at Deutsche Bank's Chief Technology Office (CTO). The person held roles like Project Lead for Contract Compliance/Tech Lead, Team Lead for Proof of Entitlement/Contractual Provisions Management, and was involved in Financial Planning and Governance for Software License Management.

Deutsche Bank is a large global financial institution with complex operations. The CTO office would deal with strategic technology initiatives across the bank.

Now, let's break down the questions one by one.

**1. STAKEHOLDER LEVELS:**

- **C-level executives (CIO, CFO, CTO, etc.)**: In this role, especially as a Project Lead or Team Lead in the CTO office, they would interact with higher-ups like the CTO themselves, possibly the Chief Procurement Office or other division heads if involved. The mention of Board of Director member tasked with expense management suggests interaction with high-level oversight.

- **Directors/VPs**: For example, as a team lead for Proof of Entitlement, they might be working with directors from IT, Legal, Finance, and Operations departments to implement processes and tools.

- **Managers**: In the roles described, they would interact with managers in various departments like Procurement, IT operations, finance teams, legal teams, etc., who are responsible for day-to-day activities related to software licensing.

- **End users**: This could include other team members or employees from divisions that use the software, as well as perhaps divisional heads if they're involved in the monthly reviews. However, end users might not be directly listed; it's more about operational staff and stakeholders who rely on these processes.

From the excerpt:

- "Set up a network of divisional stakeholders" – This implies interaction with multiple divisions across the bank.

- "Hold monthly review sessions with all parts of DB" – Suggests broad engagement, including senior finance or management personnel.

- "Provide automated KPI reporting to Board member" – Involves C-level and possibly other executives if they're part of the review chain.

So, stakeholders range from:

- **C-level**: Involved in strategic oversight and ensuring compliance with financial controls.

- **Directors/VPs**: Likely involved in steering committees or as functional leads (e.g., Legal for contractual aspects, Procurement for sourcing).

- **Managers**: Department heads who implement the processes, like IT managers handling software inventory or finance managers dealing with budgets.

- **End users**: While not explicitly mentioned, they might be indirectly affected and could provide feedback on proof of entitlement tools. But in this context, it's more about ensuring their needs are met through process improvements rather than direct user interaction.

**2. FUNCTIONS INVOLVED:**

I need to identify which organizational functions were engaged based on the activities described.

- **Legal**: Involved because there are contractual conditions and provisions that must be managed, reviewed, and ensured compliance with. The proof of entitlement ensures that contracts reference each other properly.

- **Procurement**: Directly involved since we're talking about software purchases, data from purchasing systems (like POs), contract visibility, etc. Procurement manages the buying process.

- **IT/Technology**: Central to this role, as it's in the CTO office dealing with software license management, reversing engineering processes, building automated applications, integrating with ServiceNow/SAM Pro, which is a technology platform for IT asset management.

- **Finance**: Involved because there are financial aspects like monitoring spend, reviewing expense lines, and reporting to boards. The Software Expense Line Owner would be part of finance or closely related.

- **Compliance**: Might not be explicitly mentioned, but ensuring contract compliance could involve compliance functions if there's regulatory oversight on software usage.

- **Operations**: Possibly involved in providing data from purchasing systems (e.g., PO line items) and using the outputs for day-to-day operations. Also, end users might come from operational teams.

Why each function is involved:

- Legal: Ensures that all contractual obligations are met and that proofs of entitlement reference existing contracts correctly to avoid non-compliance risks.

- Procurement: Provides data on software purchases (e.g., POs), manages the sourcing process, and ensures that contracts are properly documented for use in PoE.

- IT/Technology: Builds the technical infrastructure for automating processes and integrating with tools like ServiceNow/SAM Pro. The CTO office is directly involved as it oversees technology strategy and implementation.

- Finance: Monitors spending against budgets, forecasts costs, reviews expense lines monthly to maintain financial control over technology assets.

- Compliance (if applicable): Although not detailed, contract compliance could have implications for regulatory adherence or internal policies that require oversight from a compliance function. But in this case, it might be more about finance and legal ensuring compliance rather than a separate compliance team being directly involved unless specified.

- Operations: Since software is used by operational teams, they need to clear purchase orders and ensure data flows correctly, but the excerpt doesn't highlight direct interaction; it's focused on enabling them through process and tool development. Still, stakeholders might include ops managers or end users from operations.

**3. ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED:**

This requires skills in navigating complex organizational structures.

- **Stakeholder management**: Essential for setting up a network with divisional stakeholders and holding monthly reviews. Need to manage relationships across multiple departments and levels.

- **Cross-functional collaboration**: Key because the role involves working with IT, Legal, Procurement, Finance, etc., each bringing different perspectives and expertise.

- **Influence without authority**: Since it's not their own department (likely), they need to drive change by convincing stakeholders from other areas. For example, getting legal teams to adopt new processes or finance to integrate data.

- **Change management**: Involves analyzing gaps in existing processes and proposing/imploring new ones, then formalizing them into automated applications – this requires managing the transition and adoption of changes effectively.

- **Negotiation**: Might be needed when discussing way forward for data quality issues with stakeholders or agreeing on which contracts should be referenced. For instance, "flag data quality issues with stakeholders and agree on way forward" implies negotiation to resolve problems.

- **Political savvy**: In a large institution like DB, multiple departments might have competing interests; e.g., IT wants flexibility, Legal needs strict compliance, Finance wants cost control. Navigating these without direct authority requires understanding organizational politics and aligning different goals.

**4. CAREER PROGRESSION INSIGHTS:**

What this period shows about career development:

- **Leadership level**: The roles evolved from being an individual contributor in 2020 (setting up stakeholder networks, monitoring spend) to team lead (leading Proof of Entitlement teams), and then to project lead with tech responsibilities. This indicates progression towards more leadership and strategic management.

  - 2020-2021: Financial Planning and Governance role – this is still somewhat individual contributor focused on data gathering, reporting, and cross-departmental interaction but not leading a team directly.

    Specifically: "As Software Expense Line Owner" might involve some responsibility, but the description says it was tasked with monitoring spend, which could be seen as an operational or analytical role under larger leadership.

  - 2021-2022: Team Lead for Proof of Entitlement – this is a clear step up to leading teams and implementing processes and tools.

    "Leading development of processes and supporting tools" shows direct team management.

  - 2022-today: Project lead role with contract compliance, which includes more strategic elements like proposing new processes and automating them. This suggests moving towards project or program management at a higher level within the CTO.

- **Scope of influence**: The person interacts with divisional stakeholders across DB, including Board members. They work on global systems (software usage across divisions) but also deal with local teams in Frankfurt. As team lead and project lead, they might have broader impact.

  - In Financial Planning: Reviewing spend for all parts of DB – so broad influence.

  - In Proof of Entitlement: Designing backend/frontend solutions to clear PO line items – this is likely impacting multiple business units or divisions within IT/Operations.

- **Strategic vs tactical work**: 

    - Early role (2020): More tactical, e.g., monitoring spend, reviewing data.

    - Mid-role (2021): Involves both strategy and implementation; leading process development for PoE.

    - Later role (2022- today): More strategic focus on contract compliance, analyzing gaps, proposing new processes, and building automated solutions that serve as tools for broader governance. The work is about ensuring the bank adheres to licensing conditions strategically.
...done thinking.

Below, I'll provide a step-by-step analysis of your query based on the career history excerpt from Deutsche Bank's Chief Technology Office (CTO) over the period 2020–present. Since you requested an expert-level breakdown, I'll consider the organizational context carefully: Deutsche Bank is a large, global financial institution with complex operations across various divisions (e.g., Wealth Management, Retail Banking, Corporate Finance), each requiring sophisticated technology management to ensure compliance, cost control, and efficient use of resources.

I'll address your four questions in order:

### 1. **STAKEHOLDER LEVELS**

Deutsche Bank is a massive organization with thousands of employees across multiple business units, regulatory bodies, and IT systems. As part of the CTO office (based in Frankfurt), this individual would interact with stakeholders at various levels to ensure software licensing processes align with financial governance, legal compliance, and operational needs.

From the excerpt:

- **C-level executives**: The role involved setting up a network with divisional stakeholders and reporting directly to Board members. For instance, "initiate appropriate action" in spend monitoring suggests high-stakes decision-making that requires input from senior leaders like the CFO (for financial oversight) or CIO/CTO (for technology strategy). This shows interaction at the executive level for strategic approvals, risk management, and governance reviews.
  
- **Directors/VPs**: As team lead for Proof of Entitlement (PoE), they would collaborate with directors from key organizational functions like Legal (e.g., Head of Contracts or Compliance), Procurement (e.g., Divisional Procurement Director), IT Operations (e.g., Director of Infrastructure Services), and Finance (e.g., VP of Treasury). This is because PoE involves cross-functional requirements—legal teams define contractual terms, procurement provides purchase data, IT manages software inventory, and finance oversees budgets. The "design and implement backend/frontend solution" implies involvement with directors to align processes across their domains.

- **Managers**: In the Project Lead role for Contract Compliance, they would work closely with managers in departments such as Procurement (e.g., Category Managers), IT Operations (e.g., Systems Administrators or Application Managers), Finance (e.g., Expense Account Managers), and Legal (e.g., Contract Specialists). For example, "identify and review data sources" might involve procurement systems teams to extract PO data, or finance managers for spend trends. The Team Lead role also requires managing internal team members, so day-to-day interactions would include IT project managers, business analysts, and possibly operations managers if end users are involved.

- **End users**: These could be employees from various divisions (e.g., Wealth Management, Retail Banking) who use software but aren't directly responsible for procurement or compliance. The individual might interact with them indirectly through monthly review sessions to gather feedback on spend trends or by providing PoE tools that affect their work. However, end user engagement is primarily tactical—e.g., "clear existing purchase order line items" could involve operational staff—who are not listed as direct stakeholders but may be involved in testing or using the outputs.

Overall stakeholder levels: This period involves a broad spectrum of interaction, from high-level C-suite involvement to hands-on managers and end users. The progression shows increasing responsibility for stakeholder engagement across all levels, particularly in 2022–present with contract compliance and automated applications that touch multiple stakeholders globally.

### 2. **FUNCTIONS INVOLVED**

The functions engaged are those responsible for different aspects of software management, from financial control to operational execution. Here's a detailed breakdown based on the activities described:

- **Legal**: Directly involved because the PoE process ensures contractual documentation is properly referenced and that licensing conditions (e.g., usage rights) are adhered to. Legal teams provide input on contract terms during PoE implementation ("ensure available contractual documentation are referred to"), which helps avoid compliance risks like unauthorized software use or breaches of license agreements.

- **Procurement**: Heavily involved as the primary source for data on software purchases (e.g., PO line items). The individual mobilizes data from procurement systems, so functions here include Contract Compliance and Proof of Entitlement teams. Procurement manages the buying process externally, ensuring that contracts are initially sourced correctly to enable the internal PoE management.

- **IT/Technology**: Central to this role due to the CTO office context; IT is involved in every aspect because software licensing falls under technology governance. For example: "reverse engineer the process" (which likely involves IT teams), "design and implement backend/frontend solutions" for PoE clearing, and integrating with ServiceNow/SAM Pro requires collaboration with IT developers or vendors.

- **Finance**: Involved primarily through monitoring spend trends and forecasting costs ("review trends in spending, compare to forecast"). Finance also supports the expense line review sessions by providing budget oversight. In this banking context, they might be involved via functions like Treasury or Expense Management teams that handle financial planning for technology assets.

- **Compliance (if applicable)**: Not explicitly mentioned but could be involved indirectly through regulatory requirements. For instance, contract compliance might align with internal policies enforced by a Compliance function to ensure adherence to laws and standards, preventing breaches during software usage.

- **Operations**: Involved as the end users of software are often from operational teams (e.g., business units). The PoE process ensures that these operations don't use non-compliant software, so managers or heads from divisions like Trading Operations might be stakeholders for feedback on tool usability ("design and implement a backend/frontend solution" to enable clearing).

Why each function is involved: Here's the reasoning in terms of organizational complexity:

- **Legal**: At DB, legal ensures that all activities comply with regulations (e.g., GDPR for data or licensing laws), which directly impacts software usage. The PoE process requires cross-referencing contracts, so Legal provides essential inputs to avoid risks like overuse or underuse.

- **Procurement**: This function sources software externally from vendors, making it critical for the initial visibility of contracts and purchase orders. DB's procurement teams might be fragmented across divisions (e.g., Global Procurement vs. Local), so coordination is key—especially when data quality issues arise ("flag data quality issues").

- **IT/Technology**: As a CTO office role, IT handles both the strategic oversight of software licenses and tactical implementation via tools like SAM Pro or ServiceNow. DB's size means that IT must work across multiple systems (e.g., SAP for finance, custom databases) to integrate PoE processes seamlessly.

- **Finance**: In a financial institution, spend monitoring is crucial due to tight budgets and expense tracking requirements. The individual likely interacts with Finance functions via standardized reporting or their role as Software Expense Line Owner, which has direct implications for cost control across the bank.

- **Compliance**: While not always visible in roles like PoE lead, it's involved when processes must meet specific standards (e.g., Basel III). Contract compliance could be audited internally by Compliance if there are regulatory concerns, but at DB, this might be more about cross-functional alignment than a dedicated team—hence no explicit mention unless relevant.

- **Operations**: These teams use software daily and need to ensure it's compliant for business continuity. Their input is vital during PoE sessions or when clearing line items; e.g., operations managers might flag issues with data sources if their tools are affected by non-standard software usage.

This analysis considers DB's structure, where functions like Legal and Procurement have distinct but interconnected roles—e.g., each division (Retail, Wealth) has its own legal and procurement arms. The individual's work likely bridges these to create a cohesive approach for managing licenses across the entire institution.

### 3. **Skills or Expertise Needed**

- Legal: Contract review skills.
- Procurement: Category management expertise in software sourcing.
- IT/Technology: System integration knowledge (e.g., API development, database querying).
- Finance: Financial modeling and reporting skills.
- Compliance: Regulatory awareness and audit coordination.
- Operations: Business process insight to understand how PoE affects their workflows.
