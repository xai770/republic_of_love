Thinking...
First, I need to understand the user's query. They're asking me to analyze a career period at Novartis in Global Sourcing IT Change Management and Governance from 2010-2016. The key is to break it down into four parts: stakeholder levels, functions involved, organizational skills required, and career progression insights.

The user specified that I'm an expert at analyzing organizational dynamics, so I should draw on general knowledge about large corporations like Novartis, which is a big pharma company with complex structures. That means the person likely dealt with multiple layers of stakeholders across different departments.

Starting with stakeholder levels: From 2012-2015 as Global Sourcing IT Change Management and Governance Lead, they managed a team or process for the whole group, so interactions would span from C-suite down to operational staff. I should list specific functions based on typical corporate org charts—think finance, legal, IT operations, etc.

Then, for 2010-2012 roles like Global Lead for Software License Management and Mobile Telecom Demand Management, these are probably early leadership roles where they were leading a team but not necessarily the entire function. I need to infer typical stakeholders based on the responsibilities mentioned, like legal in software compliance or finance in cost savings.

For functions involved, it's clear from the description that IT is central—sourcing tech services and managing licenses. But other functions are likely involved due to cross-departmental needs: Finance for costs, Legal for contracts, HR if there were employees using software, Operations for telecom usage, etc. I should map each function to why they're relevant.

Organizational skills required: The roles sound like they demand a lot of stakeholder management and collaboration because the person was leading initiatives across different areas without direct authority in some cases. For example, negotiating with SAP or working with legal teams shows need for influence and change management.

Career progression insights: This period shows growth from individual contributor to team leadership, moving from tactical tasks like evaluating TEMS providers to strategic roles involving global processes. I should note the shift from specific projects to broader governance responsibilities over time.

I need to ensure my response is structured clearly with numbered points or bullet lists as requested. Keep it professional and concise.
...done thinking.

    *   Employees using SAP or other enterprise software globally: Indirectly involved through impact on their ability to use systems, training needs, or potential data contributors/errors.

## 2. FUNCTIONS INVOLVED

This period required engagement with multiple functions due to the cross-cutting nature of global sourcing and IT governance:

*   **IT (Information Technology):** Central function responsible for managing technology infrastructure, applications (like SAP), system licenses, software deployment, change management, security compliance, and technical support. Involved in defining requirements for sourcing tools, implementing and maintaining systems like TEMS or ELMA platforms, ensuring license usage is tracked correctly within IT systems, and providing subject matter expertise on technology.
    *   **WHY:** The core focus was on managing the IT category (Software, Mobile Telecoms, Network), designing backend systems, integrating data from various sources, reporting against IT KPIs, and dealing with technical aspects of sourcing tools.

*   **Finance/ Treasury/Cost Management:** Involved in understanding spend patterns, evaluating cost-saving initiatives (like TEMS), Supply Chain Finance likely involved in TTM negotiations or funding considerations.
    *   **WHY:** Managing costs is a core function. The role required reporting on spend and savings, negotiating settlements based partly on financial impact, and potentially liaising with finance for budget cycles.

*   **Legal/Compliance (Covers Legal):** Involved for contract review, ensuring compliance with software license agreements, providing legal input during negotiations, managing risk related to non-compliance.
    *   **WHY:** Software License Management involved critical contracts. The person acted as a subject matter expert on contracts and templates, interacting directly with the legal team.

*   **Operations (Logistics/Telecom Operations):** Involved in understanding telecom usage, providing input for TEMS forecasts, ensuring that policies were understood and adopted by end-users.
    *   **WHY:** Telecom services are essential for business operations. The goal was to manage spend related to mobile telecoms used by Novartis employees or subsidiaries.

*   **Software Development/ Engineering (Internal):** Involved in understanding how licenses are consumed internally, identifying potential gaps via application analysis, and ensuring compliance with internal software development lifecycles.
    *   **WHY:** The SAP ELMA program involved analyzing existing applications to manage license usage effectively. Also, telecom initiatives might involve integrating TEMS data into internal systems.

*   **Procurement/ Sourcing (Global Sourcing Office):** Involved as the central function driving these activities, coordinating with other functions and stakeholders.
    *   **WHY:** This role was defined within Global Sourcing itself or closely aligned. The person managed parts of the sourcing process including evaluation, reporting, and governance.

*   **HR (Potentially involved via IT systems):** Involved in understanding software usage by employees for license tracking and compliance purposes.
    *   **WHY:** Software licenses often relate to employee access and use, which falls under HR's purview. However, the description focuses more on IT aspects, so direct interaction might be minimal unless specific HR systems were involved.

*   **Marketing/ Sales (if relevant):** Potentially involved for understanding mobile telecom usage patterns or policies affecting them.
    *   **WHY:** Less directly mentioned, but business units often drive software and telecom needs. The person worked with business partners to understand savings levers like policy adjustments.

## 3. ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED

This period required a diverse set of organizational skills:

*   **Stakeholder Management (High Importance):** Dealing with multiple groups: finance, legal, IT ops, vendors, and business unit managers who have different priorities, concerns, and levels of authority.
    *   Managing relationships with the Legal team to ensure smooth contract negotiations and compliance guidance.
    *   Aligning with Finance on KPIs, reporting formats, and cost-saving benefits.
    *   Collaborating with IT Operations for accurate data collection and tool implementation.
    *   Influencing software developers and business unit managers to adopt standardized practices.

*   **Cross-functional Collaboration (Essential):** The role demanded working across clearly distinct functions like IT operations, Finance, Legal, and potentially others. For instance:
    *   Working with IT teams on technical aspects of the reporting backend.
    *   Liaising with Finance for spend data integration.
    *   Coordinating with Operations to understand telecom needs.

*   **Influence without Authority (High Importance):** In a matrix organization like Novartis, this role likely required significant influence over functions not directly supervised. Examples include:
    *   Negotiating favorable terms and settlements with vendors (e.g., SAP) by leveraging the central function's authority.
    *   Persuading business units to adhere to governance policies or provide necessary data for accurate reporting.

*   **Change Management:** Implementing new processes, systems (like TEMS, ELMA), and standard operating procedures across a large organization requires significant change management skills. This involves planning, communication, training, and managing resistance.
    *   Leading the redesign of license measurement processes meant implementing a new way of working for many stakeholders.

*   **Negotiation:** Crucial in both roles:
    *   Software License Management: Negotiating terms with SAP (bulk purchases).
    *   Telecom Expense Management: Drafting and finalizing the Vodafone MSA, negotiating savings targets.

*   **Political Savvy (Implicit):** Navigating the complexities of a large global organization requires understanding organizational politics. This involves building coalitions, anticipating resistance from different departments (e.g., IT might resist perceived bureaucracy), communicating effectively with senior leaders to gain buy-in and resources, and managing relationships carefully across functions.

## 4. CAREER PROGRESSION INSIGHTS

This period demonstrates a clear progression towards strategic leadership roles in procurement:

*   **Leadership Level:**
    *   Initially (2010-2012): Global Lead positions suggest moving from individual contributor to team/program lead, likely at the Manager level or slightly higher. Managing projects and providing expertise indicates early leadership.
    *   From 2012 onwards: The role of "Global Sourcing IT Change Management and Governance" implies a more strategic function within the sourcing organization, possibly Director-level if overseeing multiple sub-categories via the core team.

*   **Scope of Influence:**
    *   Early roles (Software License Mgmt, Telecom Lead) involved leading specific initiatives or aspects but likely still reporting to higher management and working with cross-functional teams. Scope was focused on software licenses and mobile telecoms.
    *   Later role (2012-2015): Expanded significantly to cover the entire "global IT category" through governance of a core team, involving multiple sub-categories (Software, Mobile Telecom, Network) and supporting other sourcing activities like RFPs. Influence grew from managing specific areas to overseeing a broader function.

*   **Strategic vs Tactical Work:**
    *   Early roles (2010-2012): More tactical/operational in nature – leading specific projects (Software ELMA, TEMS evaluation), providing compliance guidance, and implementing tools. Focus was on execution and achieving specific outcomes like license redesign or TEMS savings verification.
    *   Later role (2015 onwards): Highly strategic and governance-focused.
        *   Setting targets and reporting to C-level executives.
        *   Designing and managing processes across the entire IT category.
        *   Implementing change management for sourcing initiatives.
        *   Managing inter-functional relationships strategically.

In summary, this period shows progression from specialized technical/specific lead roles towards a broader strategic sourcing function involving governance, process improvement, stakeholder alignment, and influencing multiple functions globally. The skills developed are crucial for senior procurement leadership in large organizations like Novartis.
