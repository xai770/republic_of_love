We have 287 professional skills extracted from job postings (like Network Security, Financial Modeling, Strategic Planning, etc.) that need to be organized into a hierarchical structure.\n\nOur goal: Build a multi-level taxonomy where recruiters can browse skills by category and match candidates to jobs based on skill hierarchies.\n\nWhat established skill taxonomy standards are you familiar with? (Examples: O*NET, ESCO, LinkedIn Skills Graph, etc.)\n\nPlease list 3-5 standards you know about."

    "content": "Hello Arden!\n\nI'm happy to help you with building a skills taxonomy for your job-candidate matching system.\n\nEstablished skill taxonomy standards are crucial for creating a robust and maintainable system. Here are 3-5 standards I'm familiar with:\n\n1. **O*NET**: The Occupational Information Network (O*NET) is a widely used taxonomic framework developed by the U.S. Department of Labor. It consists of over 1,000 occupations and 150 job titles, organized into six broad categories: Management, Business & Finance, Healthcare, Science, Technology, Arts, Recreation, Outdoor Leisure & Conserve, and Service.\n\n2. **ESCO (Occupational Information Network)**: ESCO is another taxonomic framework that provides a structured system for categorizing occupations. Developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), it consists of 1,000 occupations grouped into 20 broad categories, including Management, Healthcare Support, Sales & Related Occupations, and Service Occupations.\n\n3. **Microsoft's Skill Level Classification System**: This taxonomy standard is used to classify skills across various Microsoft platforms, including LinkedIn and Azure. It categorizes skills into four levels:\n * Fundamental: Basic skills required for a job\n * Core: Essential skills for a job\n * Advanced: Skills that are beneficial but not essential\n * Expert: Highly specialized skills\n\n4. **ISO 19764-1 (Skills Taxonomy)**: This is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It provides a framework for creating and maintaining skill taxonomies, including guidelines for categorizing and coding skills.\n\n5. **Linkedin Skills Graph**: Although not as widely adopted as other standards, LinkedIn's Skills Graph taxonomy has some relevance here. It uses a hierarchical structure to organize skills into categories like Business & Finance, Technology, Creative & Design, etc.\n\nKeep in mind that each standard has its strengths and weaknesses. You may need to adapt or combine elements from multiple sources to create an optimal taxonomy for your specific use case.\n\nWhich of these standards do you think might be a good starting point for your project?"

    "content": "Based on your knowledge of these taxonomy standards, which ONE would you recommend we adopt as our foundation for a job-candidate matching system?\n\nPlease explain:\n- Which standard you recommend\n- Why it's the best fit for job matching\n- What the top-level categories are in that standard\n- How many levels deep the hierarchy typically goes"
  },

    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Based on my analysis, I recommend adopting O*NET as the foundation for your job-candidate matching system. Here's why:\n\n1. **Widely adopted and established**: O*NET is a well-established taxonomy with over 1,000 occupations and 150 job titles, making it a reliable and widely recognized standard.\n2. **Broad categories**: O*NET organizes skills into six broad categories: Management, Business & Finance, Healthcare, Science, Technology, Arts, Recreation, Outdoor Leisure & Conserve, and Service. These categories provide a good starting point for organizing your own taxonomy.\n3. **Hierarchical structure**: While not as deeply hierarchical as some other standards, O*NET uses a generalization-specialization hierarchy to organize occupations. This means that each occupation is related to more specific job titles, allowing for a decent level of granularity without becoming too complex.\n4. **Alignment with industry needs**: O*NET is developed in collaboration with various stakeholders from the education and workforce development sectors, ensuring its relevance to industry needs.\n\nThe top-level categories in O*NET are:\n\n1. Management\n2. Business & Finance\n3. Healthcare\n4. Science\n5. Technology\n6. Arts, Recreation, Outdoor Leisure & Conserve\n7. Service\n\nO*NET's hierarchy typically goes up to 3-4 levels deep, with job titles nested under occupations and categories. For example:\n\n* Occupation: Software Engineer\n\t+ Category: Information\n\t+ Subcategory: Data\n\t+ Job title: Software Developer (a more specific role within the occupation)\n\nWhile O*NET is a good starting point, you may need to adapt or add new categories/subcategories as required by your system.\n\nUsing O*NET as a foundation will provide a solid structure for your skills taxonomy and allow you to build upon its framework."
