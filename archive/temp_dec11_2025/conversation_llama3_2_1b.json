Read the job posting\n2. Extract all skills, technologies, and requirements\n3. For each term, determine:\n   - MATCH: Already in our dictionary (show path)\n   - NEW_TERM: Not in dictionary (propose where to add it)\n   - SYNONYM: Linguistic variation (link to canonical term)\n   - QUESTION: You're uncertain (ask for my decision)\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT (use exact delimiters):\n+++OUTPUT START+++\nMATCHES:\n[path] \u2192 [term]\n\nNEW_TERMS:\n[term] \u2192 SUGGEST: [proposed_path] ([reasoning])\n\nSYNONYMS:\n[term] \u2192 ALIAS_FOR: [canonical_path]\n\nQUESTIONS:\n[term] \u2192 [your question about categorization]\n+++OUTPUT END+++\n\nGUIDELINES:\n- Be specific with paths (e.g., TECHNICAL/DATABASE/PostgreSQL not just DATABASE)\n- Group similar technologies (React and Angular both under FRAMEWORK)\n- Separate what you DO (code) from HOW you work (soft skills)\n- When uncertain, ask rather than guess\n\nGOAL: Create a mathematically provable matching system where semantic distance = path distance.\n\nReady? Here's the job posting:\n\n---\nJob Summary: \nApply for a Frontend Developer position at Tech Innovators Inc. We are seeking a skilled frontend developer to join our dynamic team and contribute to the development of cutting-edge web applications. The ideal candidate should have expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React or Angular.

Frontend development, web applications, etc.?\n- What are some specific technologies mentioned that might be challenging for non-experts to learn or use (e.g., Git, RESTful APIs)?\n\nUSER: Got it! I'd like to ask a few clarifying questions before proceeding.\n\n1. You mentioned HTML, CSS, JavaScript as core web technologies. However, you also said React and Angular are frameworks. How do we handle this? Should they be categorized under Frameworks/Databases, or should we consider them subcategories within the Frameworks/Databases path?\n\n2. What about RESTful APIs? While it's true that REST is a design pattern, it's more of a technical standard than a skill. However, if we're considering the job posting as a whole, how would you like to handle this term? Should we focus on the underlying technology (API design patterns), or should we consider it a soft skill?\n\n3. You mentioned that Frontend Programming Languages is a category within the Javascript/Skills path. Is this correct? If so, what other programming languages could be included in this category?\n\nUSER: Thank you for addressing my questions!\n\nASSISTANT: Based on our understanding of the hierarchy, I'll proceed with categorizing each term.\n\n**MATCHES:**\n\n- TECHNICAL/FRAMEWORKS/SWERGE Technologies: [Frameworks/Databases]\n  \u2192 SUGGEST: Frameworks/[Canonic Path] (React/PostgreSQL)\n- TECHNICAL/PROGRAMMING/JavaScript\n  \u2192 SUGGEST: Frontend Programming Languages ([Reasoning - This term is likely referring to a programming language used for building web applications])\n- TECHNICAL/WEB_TECHNOLOGIES/CSS\n  \u2192 SUGGEST: Web Styling Frameworks ([Reasoning - Similar to HTML, this term could be related to styling frameworks like TailwindCSS or Bootstrap]\n- TECHNICAL/FRAMEWORK/API/RESTful Technologies: [API Design Patterns] ([Reasoning - This term is likely referring to the underlying API design patterns used for building web applications])\n\nSYNONYMS:\n- HTML\n  \u2192 ALIAS_FOR: [Web Development Frameworks]\n- CSS\n  \u2192 ALIAS_FOR: [Web Styling Frameworks]\n\nQUESTIONS:\n- How would you like to handle the RESTful APIs term? Should we focus on the underlying API design patterns, or should we consider it a soft skill?\n- Can you elaborate on the Frontend Programming Languages category within the Javascript/Skills path?\n\nUSER: Got it! I think we have a good understanding of how to categorize each term.\n\nASSISTANT: Based on our current taxonomy, here's an updated list:\n\n**MATCHES:**\n\n- TECHNICAL/FRAMEWORKS/SWERGE Technologies: [Frameworks/Databases] (React/PostgreSQL)\n- TECHNICAL/PROGRAMMING/JavaScript\n  \u2192 SUGGEST: Frontend Programming Languages ([Reasoning - This term is likely referring to a programming language used for building web applications])\n- TECHNICAL/WEB_TECHNOLOGIES/CSS\n  \u2192 SUGGEST: Web Styling Frameworks ([Reasoning - Similar to HTML, this term could be related to styling frameworks like TailwindCSS or Bootstrap]\n- TECHNICAL/FRAMEWORK/API/RESTful Technologies: [API Design Patterns] ([Reasoning - This term is likely referring to the underlying API design patterns used for building web applications])\n\nSYNONYMS:\n- HTML\n  \u2192 ALIAS_FOR: [Web Development Frameworks]\n- CSS\n  \u2192 ALIAS_FOR: [Web Styling Frameworks]\n\nQUESTIONS:\n- Should we consider RESTful APIs as a soft skill or a subcategory within the API/RESTful Technologies path?\n- Is it worth creating a separate category for Frontend Programming Languages, given its broad applicability to web development?\n\n---\n\nBased on our current understanding, I propose adding HTML and CSS as subcategories under Web Styling Frameworks. We can then create a new path under TECHNICAL/FRAMEWORKS/SWERGE Technologies.\n\nAdditionally, considering RESTful APIs as a soft skill or a subcategory within the API/RESTful Technologies path makes sense.\n\nLet me know if this updated taxonomy meets your requirements!"
