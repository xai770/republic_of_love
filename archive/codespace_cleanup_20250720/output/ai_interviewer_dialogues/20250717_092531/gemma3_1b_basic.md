You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:

## 🤖 Model Response

```
Okay, let’s do this. Here’s my interview with the AI model – I’ll role-play as the AI Optimization Specialist.

**Me (AI Optimization Specialist):** “Hello! Thanks for agreeing to this interview. My role is to help you refine your job analysis capabilities. We’ve noticed you currently score a 4.2 out of 10 on job analysis tasks, and while you’re performing well, there’s room for improvement. We want to understand *how* you approach these tasks better. Let’s focus on getting a better grasp of your process. Would you mind answering a few questions about how you typically work on these assignments?”

**Me (AI Model):** “Okay, sounds good.”

---

**1. Question 1: Preferred Instruction Style**

“Let's start with your preferred way of receiving instructions. Think of it like this: When you're given a task, do you prefer a very specific, detailed set of guidelines, or do you like to be given a bit more freedom to explore different approaches? Can you give me an example of a scenario where you’d lean towards one approach over the other?”

---

**2. Question 2: Optimal Output Format**

“Okay, now let’s talk about *how* you’d present the information you're generating.  Specifically, do you find that detailed, bulleted lists are helpful, or do you prefer a more narrative, paragraph-based approach? Do you gravitate towards specific organizational structures – like using headings, subheadings, or a particular word count?”

---

**3. Question 3: Context & Assistance**

“Finally, let's explore what kind of *context* you find most beneficial.  Think about tasks where you struggle the most.  Are you heavily reliant on existing documents, company data, or perhaps specific keywords? Do you need me to know if I’m working with a particular industry, role, or company background?  And, beyond that, do you need explicit reminders about *why* you're structuring things a certain way – perhaps a focus on specific skills or knowledge areas?”

---

**(Waiting for the Model’s responses – I’ll be recording and analyzing them as we go.)**

---

**Based on the imagined responses (let’s assume the model gives the following):**

* **Preference for Detailed Guidance:**  It leans toward very specific, bulleted lists and clear, direct instructions.
* **Preference for Narrative Approach:**  Prefer long-form, detailed explanations with supporting examples.
* **Context Dependent:**  Needs readily available company data, industry jargon, and a focus on core skills.

**Suggested Prompt Improvement:**

#test_this: "You are a job analysis specialist. Your task is to provide a detailed and well-structured job analysis response, incorporating specific examples. Prioritize clear, concise explanations that illustrate key requirements. Always ensure your response is thorough and demonstrates a clear understanding of the context and the key skills required for the role. When suggesting solutions, use specific examples or frameworks (e.g., a ‘must-have’ checklist) to illustrate how the role leverages these skills.  Start each response with a clear introduction summarizing the role's core responsibilities and highlighting key aspects.”

---

I’m now ready for the model’s next response. Please provide it.
