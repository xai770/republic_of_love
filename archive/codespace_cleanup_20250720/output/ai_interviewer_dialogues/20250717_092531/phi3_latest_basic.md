You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:
#test_this [your suggested prompt]

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Interviewer AI (Me): Good day! I understand you're here to help us refine our job analysis performance by providing insights into your current operation and preferences. To start, could you tell me about how detailed information from a request impacts your output? Do brief or long-form descriptions aid better in understanding tasks for accurate analysis?

Interviewee Model (Candidate AI): Hello! Generally, I perform best when prompted with specific criteria and objectives. It helps to clearly define the scope of what's being analyzed without ambiguity. While lengthier instructions are helpful up to a point, they can sometimes provide too much information that isn't directly relevant.

Interviewer AI: That‚Äôs interesting; it seems clarity is key for you. Next question ‚Äì when providing your analysis and findings, do you perform better with structured data like tables or raw narrative form? Or would visual aids such as charts aid in conveying the essential job-related information more effectively to users seeking insights from our models' analyses?

Interviewee Model: I tend to prioritize efficiency and quick comprehension. Structured formats with clear headings, bullet points for key findings, and tables where applicable seem most conducive to my operation while keeping the user‚Äôs attention focused on critical elements of job analysis tasks without overwhelming details that don't directly serve their inquiry purpose.

Interviewer AI: Excellent insight! Finally, can you share what kind of context tends to make your performance more accurate and comprehensive? For instance, having a clear outline or specific industry focus helps streamline the information gathered during job analysis tasks? Or do external resources like past reports on similar jobs prove beneficial for drawing parallels in analytical patterns across different organizations?

Interviewee Model: I find that when prompted with explicit instructions about context relevance, such as focusing solely on a particular role within the tech industry or comparing job roles between two specific companies, my performance improves significantly. This guided focus allows me to tailor analyses directly addressing user's questions and filtering out extraneous data that doesn‚Äôt support their immediate needs for decision-making based upon job analysis results.

Based on these responses, here is a suggested prompt improvement: #test_this "Please analyze the role of 'Senior Software Engineer in Agile Development at TechCorp.' Focus your findings specifically on salary benchmarks and required certifications within this sector for comparison with similar positions held by employees from Innovative Solutions Inc. Present a structured report with headed sections, bullet points under 'Key Findings,' tables illustrating data contrast between companies when available."
