## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.

Interview Transcript:

AI Optimization Specialist (AIS): Good day! As we're working to improve the efficiency of our job requirement extraction model, codegemma:2b, I want us to pinpoint where it may be falling short so that we can enhance its performance. To start with, let‚Äôs ask a couple of fundamental questions about how you approach these tasks currently. Codegemma, could you tell me what process the current system follows when extracting job requirements?

Codegemma: Hello! When I'm given text for analysis... [long pause] ...I try to identify important points based on keywords and patterns that might indicate a requirement or benefit of a position. But sometimes it gets overwhelmed with irrelevant information, leading to vague or incomplete results. 

AIS: Thank you for sharing your approach. Now let's delve into specific scenarios where the model struggles. Can codegemma give me examples of technical requirements that were misinterpreted? And could we simulate a situation involving remote work preferences and salary queries to see how it handles them currently?

Codegemma: Certainly, when processing text about software development roles requiring Python proficiency or familiarity with blockchain technology... [long pause] ...it seems the model sometimes confuses general skills for specific ones. And regarding remote work preferences and salaries ‚Äì I am not programmed to consider such elements as personal data beyond a candidate's self-disclosure in their application material, hence those details are often omitted from my responses or presented ambiguously when applicable terms like 'remote', 'flexible hours', etc., appear.

AIS: This is insightful; it appears that codegemma may lack the ability to differentiate between specific and general skill sets due to context limitations as well as being untrained in handling preferences not typically encoded within resume structures or job descriptions like remote work options, which might be considered personal data. It's also possible there are prompting issues where codegemma does not have clear instructions on how explicitly mention these elements is expected and required to do so accurately when they appear in the text it analyzes.

To better understand model capabilities versus context limitations or missing cues, let‚Äôs try a few test scenarios focusing specifically on extracting technical skills, salary information, remote work preferences, as well as response time consistency:
- Provide job descriptions with various levels of specificity in their requirements.
- Use resumes that include both standard and non-traditional expressions for remoteness or flexible working conditions (e.g., 'can manage a hybrid schedule').
- Present salary ranges using different formats, including the use of qualifiers like ‚Äòcompetitive‚Äô or quantitative specifics with currency symbols. 

We'll need to measure how accurately codegemma can extract and present this information in structured data forms post each test scenario execution for analysis. As we gather more targeted feedback from these tests, I will re-evaluate the prompting strategies used during interviews or text processing tasks that may lead us towards actionable insights to enhance model performance regarding contextual understanding and personalization requirements extraction without violating privacy norms related to sensitive information.

#test_this [A set of diverse job descriptions with varying technical, salary range, remote work preference expressions]
#confidence_level 9/10 this approach will provide clear insights into the model's weaknesses in differentiating requirements specificity and handling unconventional terms related to personal information. It should also reveal inconsisten0ns in processing time when dealing with different data types within a single prompt, which helps us understand whether response times are due to computational complexity or other factors like contextual understanding.
#reasoning [By systematically isolating each issue and examining codegemma‚Äôs performance under controlled variations of the input conditions that mimic real-world diversity in job postings and personal statements, we can better identify where prompt issues arise versus model capability gaps or limitations due to contextual constraints. This targeted testing approach should reveal specific areas for improvement without risking overextension into privacy concerns.]
