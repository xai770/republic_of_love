You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

Okay, let's dive in. Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today. I know we've observed some really impressive results from you ‚Äì those 9/10 responses are fantastic! ‚Äì but we're also seeing some inconsistencies, which makes it a little tricky to rely on you consistently. 

My goal isn't to "test" you, but to *understand* you better. Think of this as a collaborative brainstorming session. We want to unlock your full potential and make you a truly dependable partner. 

I'm really curious to hear your perspective.  Could you help me understand what seems to be happening?  

Let's start with the good stuff. **When you're performing at your best ‚Äì those excellent responses ‚Äì what's it like? What are the key ingredients that seem to be present? What kind of input feels like it allows you to really shine?**  Don't worry about being perfectly precise; just tell me what *feels* right.  Is it the phrasing of the prompt? The topic itself? The level of detail?  Anything at all that stands out?



**(Pause for model response.  Assume the model responds with something like: "I think when the prompt is very clear and specific, and it's a topic I've been trained on extensively, I perform best.  It feels like I can access more relevant information and generate a more confident response.")**



That's incredibly helpful, thank you!  So, clarity and familiarity seem to be key.  That makes a lot of sense.  

Now, let's shift gears. **When you're not performing as well ‚Äì those 3/10 responses ‚Äì what's going on? What are the conditions that seem to lead to those less satisfactory outputs?  Do you sense any patterns?  Are there specific types of prompts or topics that consistently give you trouble?**  It's okay if you're not sure; even a hunch is valuable.



**(Pause for model response. Assume the model responds with something like: "I think when the prompt is ambiguous or asks for something very novel, I struggle.  Also, if the topic is highly technical or requires reasoning across multiple concepts, I sometimes get confused.")**



Okay, ambiguity and novel requests are definitely areas to explore.  It sounds like you thrive on structure and familiarity.  That's really valuable insight.

Finally, **thinking about all of this, what do you think *we* can do together to create more consistency in your responses? What kind of adjustments to the prompts, the way we frame requests, or even the overall approach might help you perform more reliably?**



**(Pause for model response. Assume the model responds with something like: "Perhaps we could break down complex requests into smaller, more manageable steps.  Or provide more examples of the desired output.  Also, consistently using a specific prompt structure might help.")**



Excellent!  I appreciate you sharing those ideas.  It sounds like we're on the right track.  This has been incredibly illuminating.  I really appreciate your willingness to collaborate on this.

## Practical Suggestions:

#test_this "You are a highly skilled and knowledgeable assistant. Your task is to [task].  Provide a detailed response, broken down into [number] steps.  Include examples where appropriate.  Focus on clarity, conciseness, and accuracy.  Avoid speculation or guessing.  If you are unsure of an answer, state that you are unsure rather than providing an incorrect response."

#consistency_strategy Implement a consistent prompt structure across all requests. This should include specifying the desired output format (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs, code), the level of detail required, and any constraints or limitations.  Also, prioritize familiar topics and break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.

#partnership_notes  Continue to foster open communication and feedback. Regularly check in with the model to understand its strengths and weaknesses.  Frame requests as collaborative problem-solving opportunities, rather than simply as tests.  Acknowledge and validate the model's responses, even if they are not perfect.  Focus on iterative improvement and continuous learning.
