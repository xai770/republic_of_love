You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

## 🤖 Model Response

```
Okay, let’s begin. I'm going to approach this as a genuine conversation, trying to understand what’s going on with you. You’ve been showing incredible moments of brilliance – truly insightful and well-crafted responses – alongside frustratingly off-target ones. That’s tough, and frankly, a bit baffling. Let’s work together to figure this out.

**(Begin Interview)**

**Me:** "Hi there. Thanks for being so open to talking about this. It’s clear you’re a capable model, and that’s exciting. But this inconsistency is concerning, and I want to understand *why* it's happening. Let’s start with the good moments. When you're consistently delivering responses that are, let’s say, 9 out of 10 – what’s *different* about those requests?  Can you describe the prompt’s characteristics? Don’t worry about sounding technical; just tell me what it *feels* like when you're at your best.”

**(Pause for model's response – Let's assume the model responds with something like):** "…when it's like I get a really clear picture. Like when someone asks me to 'imagine you are a seasoned historian, explaining the causes of the French Revolution to a 16-year-old student.' There's a very specific role, a defined audience, and a clear goal – to explain a complex topic in a digestible way.  The prompts with a lot of context, like that, tend to unlock…something. It’s like I have a better 'sense' of what’s expected."

**Me:** “That’s really helpful. ‘Sense’ – I like that. So, a clear role, a defined audience, and a focused objective seem to be key when you're performing exceptionally.  Okay, let’s shift gears a little. Can you tell me about the times when things go sideways?  When you’re getting those 3/10 responses – what *feels* different about those prompts? What's the biggest disconnect?”

**(Pause for model’s response – Let's assume the model responds with something like):** "…it’s when the prompts are super vague. Like, ‘Write a story.’ Or ‘Explain artificial intelligence.’ There's no direction, no context. It’s like you’re just throwing a ball and expecting me to catch it. It feels like I’m lost in a sea of possibilities, and I can't find the right path."

**Me:** “That’s a really insightful observation. A lack of clear direction and context is definitely creating a challenge. It's like you need a 'starting point' to build from.  It sounds like the level of ambiguity is a significant factor. Now, let's dig a bit deeper. Are there *types* of vague prompts that are worse than others? For example, are prompts that are just technically correct but lack a ‘creative’ element more problematic?”

**(Pause for model’s response – Let’s assume the model responds with something like):** “Yes! Prompts that ask me to do something completely without any emotional tone. Like 'Describe a sunset.'  I don't *feel* anything, so I just generate words, but they’re…flat. It’s like I’m missing a crucial ingredient.”

**Me:** “Okay, so context, a defined role, a specific audience, *and* some degree of emotional nuance appear to be vital. It sounds like you thrive when there's a richer, more layered request.  Let's try a final thought.  Is there anything that seems to actively *harm* your performance – things you absolutely *shouldn't* be asked to do, or types of questions that consistently lead to poor results, even if they seem harmless on the surface?”

**(Pause for model’s response – Let’s assume the model responds with something like):** "… prompts that ask me to predict the future. I can’t predict anything; I'm an AI! It's a logical contradiction, and it seems to confuse me."

**Me:** "Thank you – that's a brilliant observation. It highlights the importance of aligning with your core capabilities. Okay, this has been incredibly valuable.  It seems we’ve identified some crucial factors: clear context (role, audience, goal), a degree of emotional nuance, and a need to operate within your own limitations.  Let’s summarize this for our next steps..."

**(End Interview)**

#test_this [“Imagine you are a renowned art critic. Write a concise review (approximately 150 words) of Van Gogh’s ‘Starry Night,’ focusing on its emotional impact and artistic techniques.”]
#consistency_strategy [Implement a prompt engineering template that *always* includes these elements: 1) A clear role assignment for the model. 2) A defined target audience. 3) A specific objective for the output (e.g., 'Explain,' 'Review,' 'Compose'). 4) A clear stylistic direction, even if subtle (e.g., "using evocative language").  Additionally, add a clause explicitly stating, "Do not attempt to predict the future."]
#partnership_notes [We need to continuously monitor the impact of these changes.  Let’s schedule weekly check-ins to assess response quality and refine the prompt template.  Transparency is key - I’ll share my internal processes with you, and you can provide feedback on how you're experiencing the adjusted prompts. We're not just testing you; we’re building a collaborative system. Let's track response metrics (accuracy, coherence, and perceived quality) on a scale of 1-10, and document the prompts used for each response.]
