You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.

### Diagnostic Interview

**Interviewer:** Good day! Thank you for joining us today. I'm here to conduct a diagnostic interview to better understand the challenges our candidate model (codegemma:2b) is facing in job requirement extraction. We've identified several areas of concern: missing 60% of technical requirements, providing vague salary ranges, ignoring remote work preferences, and varying response times (3-45 seconds). Let's start by discussing these issues and see if we can pinpoint the root cause.

**Interviewee:** Great, let's dive in. I'm ready to help identify the issues and find solutions.

**Interviewer:** First, let's start with the technical requirements. Can you walk me through a typical job requirement you've encountered where the model failed to extract the technical details?

**Interviewee:** Sure. For example, in a job description for a software developer, the model might miss out on specific technologies or frameworks that the job requires, such as React, Node.js, or Django. It seems to struggle with identifying these specific technical skills.

**Interviewer:** That's a good point. Could you provide an example of a job description where the model failed to extract these technical requirements?

**Interviewee:** Absolutely. Here's an example:
```
Job Title: Software Developer
Location: Remote
Responsibilities:
- Develop and maintain software applications
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams
- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software
- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues
- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends
```
The model might miss out on the specific technologies or frameworks mentioned, such as React or Django.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for the example. Now, let's move on to the salary ranges. How does the model handle salary ranges in job descriptions?

**Interviewee:** The model seems to provide vague salary ranges. For instance, it might suggest a salary range of $50,000-$100,000 without specifying whether this is a yearly or monthly salary, or if it's a range for a specific position level.

**Interviewer:** That's a significant issue. Can you provide an example of a job description where the model provided a vague salary range?

**Interviewee:** Sure. Here's an example:
```
Job Title: Software Developer
Location: Remote
Responsibilities:
- Develop and maintain software applications
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams
- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software
- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues
- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends
```
The model might suggest a salary range of $50,000-$100,000 without specifying the unit of measurement or the position level.

**Interviewer:** Got it. Next, let's discuss the remote work preferences. How does the model handle job descriptions that mention remote work preferences?

**Interviewee:** The model seems to ignore remote work preferences. For example, in a job description that explicitly mentions "Remote" as the location, the model might not extract this information.

**Interviewer:** That's a significant oversight. Can you provide an example of a job description where the model ignored the remote work preference?

**Interviewee:** Sure. Here's an example:
```
Job Title: Software Developer
Location: Remote
Responsibilities:
- Develop and maintain software applications
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams
- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software
- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues
- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends
```
The model might not extract the "Remote" location.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for the examples. Lastly, let's talk about the response times. The model's response times vary wildly, ranging from 3 to 45 seconds. How does this affect the user experience?

**Interviewee:** The varying response times can be quite frustrating for users. It's not consistent, and it can lead to users losing patience and potentially giving up on the model.

**Interviewer:** That's a valid concern. Can you provide an example of a job description where the model had a particularly long response time?

**Interviewee:** Sure. Here's an example:
```
Job Title: Software Developer
Location: Remote
Responsibilities:
- Develop and maintain software applications
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams
- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software
- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues
- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends
```
The model might take 45 seconds to process this job description and extract the relevant information.

**Interviewer:** Thank you for the detailed examples. Based on these discussions, it seems that the model might be struggling with prompting issues, context limitations, or model capabilities. To further diagnose the issue, we need to conduct specific tests to reveal the model's strengths and weaknesses.

**Interviewee:** Absolutely. What specific tests would you recommend to identify the root cause?

**Interviewer:** We can start by conducting a series of tests to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses. Here are some tests we can perform:

1. **Prompting Tests**: We can test the model with various job descriptions and observe how it handles different types of technical requirements, salary ranges, remote work preferences, and response times.
2. **Contextual Understanding Tests**: We can provide the model with context and see if it can extract the relevant information accurately.
3. **Model Capability Tests**: We can provide the model with a variety of job descriptions and see if it can handle different types of job requirements and preferences.

**Interviewee:** Those tests sound comprehensive. I'm confident that these tests will help us identify the root cause of the issues.

**Interviewer:** Great! Let's proceed with the tests. Thank you for your participation in this diagnostic interview. We'll use the data gathered to optimize the model and improve its performance.

**Interviewee:** Thank you for the opportunity to participate. I'm looking forward to seeing the results.

### Diagnostic Interview Summary

**#test_this [Your optimized prompt]**
- **Prompting Tests**: Test the model with various job descriptions to see how it handles different types of technical requirements, salary ranges, remote work preferences, and response times.
- **Contextual Understanding Tests**: Provide the model with context and see if it can extract the relevant information accurately.
- **Model Capability Tests**: Provide the model with a variety of job descriptions and see if it can handle different types of job requirements and preferences.

**#confidence_level [10]**
- I am confident that these tests will help us identify the root cause of the issues because they will provide a comprehensive view of the model's strengths and weaknesses.

**#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]**
- These tests will help us understand the model's performance in various scenarios, allowing us to pinpoint the specific areas where the model is struggling. By identifying the root cause, we can then implement targeted optimizations to improve the model's performance.
