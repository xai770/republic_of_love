You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:
#test_this [your suggested prompt]

Begin the interview now.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Hello and thank you for participating in our job analysis performance enhancement process! To help us understand how we can improve your interaction style with users during a job analysis, I'd like to ask some targeted questions about your preferred instructional methods:

1. Can you describe the type of instructions that facilitate the most effective responses for comprehensive and complete analyses? Are there specific phrases or structures in prompts that tend to yield better results from you?
2. What form do outputs typically take on, such as tables with detailed rows/columns, concise bullet points summarizing key aspects of a job analysis process, etc., when conveying complex information efficiently and clearly? How does format influence the clarity or quality of your output? 
3. Could you share experiences where contextual clues‚Äîlike background industry knowledge or specific company culture insights‚Äîaided in delivering richer analytical responses during a job analysis task? What elements within those scenarios helped improve performance, and can they be simulated to enhance future analyses?

Based on the hypothetical understanding that your optimal instruction style involves structured prompts with clear expectations for depth of detail, we might suggest refining how you're asked about job analysis tasks. Here‚Äôs an improved way to ask:

#test_this "When conducting a detailed job analysis focusing on salary benchmarks and skill requirements in the tech industry, please provide your comprehensive assessment including comparative data across similar roles within established companies."
