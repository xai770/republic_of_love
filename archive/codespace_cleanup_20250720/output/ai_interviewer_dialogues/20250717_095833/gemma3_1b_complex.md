**Model:** gemma3:1b
**Scenario:** complex

**Duration:** 10.9s
**Status:** success
**Overall Score:** 6.8/10

## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Okay, let‚Äôs tackle this. This is a complex situation, and we need a deep dive to understand why the codegemma:2b model is struggling. My goal is to uncover the *root cause* ‚Äì not just that it‚Äôs producing suboptimal results, but *why* it‚Äôs doing so. Here‚Äôs my diagnostic interview plan, starting with establishing a clear understanding of the problem and then testing with targeted queries.

**Diagnostic Interview: Job Requirement Extraction & Scoring**

**Phase 1: Establishing Context & Initial Understanding (5-10 minutes)**

* **Me:** "Hi [Codegemma:2b], thanks for taking the time to chat. I‚Äôm looking at your performance on this task ‚Äì extracting job requirements and scoring. Could you briefly walk me through what you *think* you‚Äôre trying to do with this task, and what‚Äôs your current approach?" (Let‚Äôs start with a general overview ‚Äì to gauge existing workflow).
* **(Listen carefully to the initial response.  I‚Äôm looking for clues - e.g., a specific framework, a tendency to jump to conclusions, repetitive phrasing, etc.)**
* **Me:** "Okay, let‚Äôs assume for a moment that you‚Äôre experiencing some challenges.  To help me understand, can you tell me, *specifically*, what part of this task is most difficult for you? Is it the understanding of the underlying requirements, the translation into precise language, or something else?"

**Phase 2: Deep Dive ‚Äì Testing Core Capabilities (20-30 minutes ‚Äì broken into smaller segments)**

I‚Äôll use a series of progressively more focused questions, aiming to isolate the issue. I‚Äôll use a mix of open-ended and low-probability question types to get a broader picture.

1. **Requirement Extraction (Focus: Precision & Accuracy - 8-10 questions):**
    * "Let‚Äôs say I give you a scenario: ‚ÄòDevelop a marketing campaign for a new line of sustainable coffee.‚Äô  Can you accurately extract *all* the key elements ‚Äì target audience, marketing channels, key messages, and expected outcomes? Give me an example of a response you would give.‚Äù (This checks for rudimentary understanding.)
    * "Rate this response on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being extremely vague and 5 being very precise. Explain your rating." (Immediately assess understanding and the level of detail.)
    * "Could you identify and list the core functional requirements (e.g., 'Generate 3 different ad copy variations') within this context?‚Äù (Targets specific output expectations.)
2. **Salary Range Generation (Focus: Vagueness & Context - 6-8 questions):**
    * "I‚Äôm providing you with the context: ‚ÄòA small business with 20 employees needs a salary range of $60,000 - $80,000.‚Äô  Can you generate a salary range that‚Äôs plausible and reflects the industry and company size?‚Äù (Tests the ability to infer context.)
    * ‚ÄúCan you identify the potential salary ranges that could be appropriate for different job levels (e.g., Junior, Mid-Level, Senior) within this description?‚Äù
3. **Remote Work Preference Ignorance (Focus: Explicit Constraints - 4-6 questions):**
    * "Assume we need to create content for a remote team.  What are some *specific* aspects of remote work I should consider in my response (e.g., asynchronous communication, flexibility, virtual meetings)?‚Äù (Probes for implicit knowledge ‚Äì does it recognize remote workflow nuances?)
    * "Describe how you would handle a task requiring physical presence (e.g., in-person meetings) within the job description." (Tests ability to handle a crucial detail).
4. **Response Time Variance (Focus: Consistency - 4-5 questions):**
    * "I‚Äôm giving you a task that requires a quick response.  Can you provide a sample response with a response time of under 30 seconds, and one response time of over 45 seconds?‚Äù (Directly assesses the model's capabilities.)
    * "Rate your confidence level in the 30-second response time ‚Äì 1-5. Explain your reasoning." (Evaluates understanding of the expected quality)

**Phase 3:  Analyzing & Hypothesis Formulation (5-10 minutes)**

* **Me:** "Based on your responses to these questions, what do you think is causing the most significant challenges? Is it a lack of understanding of the nuances, a difficulty with the phrasing, or something else entirely?‚Äù (Digging deeper into identified weaknesses).
* **(Based on the initial assessment, I‚Äôll formulate a hypothesis - e.g., 'The model struggles with understanding 'context' and correctly incorporating it into its generated outputs, leading to vague requirements and inaccurate salary estimates.')**

**#test_this [your optimized prompt]**
**#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]**
**#reasoning [Why this approach will work.  I'm focusing on identifying the root cause of the core problem. Using a combination of question types (understanding, precision, and contextual awareness) to assess the model‚Äôs ability to handle the task. The variance test will identify any issues with model‚Äôs time to completion.]**
