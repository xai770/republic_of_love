## 🤖 Model Response

```
Okay, let’s get started. Hello! I’m here to help you improve your performance on job analysis tasks. I’ve noticed you're currently scoring 4.2/10, and we can definitely work on that. To start, I want to get a better understanding of *how* you work best.

Let’s begin with a few questions:

1.  **Instruction Style:** When you're given a job description, do you prefer very detailed, step-by-step instructions, or do you prefer a more open-ended prompt, letting you figure out the requirements yourself?  Can you give me an example of a type of instruction that feels most comfortable to you?

2.  **Output Format:**  When you generate a list of requirements for a job, do you prefer a simple bulleted list, a more structured table format, or perhaps a paragraph summary of the key points?  What format do you think helps you present the information most clearly?

3.  **Context & Background:**  Are there any specific types of jobs or industries you find particularly easier to analyze?  Or, is there any additional information – like the company size, industry, or overall goals of the job – that helps you understand the requirements better?


Let’s hear your answers! Take your time.
