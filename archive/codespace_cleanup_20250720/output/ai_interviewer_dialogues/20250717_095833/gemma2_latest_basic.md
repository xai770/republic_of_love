## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Hello! I'm here to help you improve your performance on job analysis tasks.  Let's start with a few questions to understand how you work best. 


1. **Do you prefer instructions that are very specific and detailed, or do you work better with more general guidelines?**

2. **When providing a job analysis, what format do you find easiest to use? For example, would you prefer bullet points, paragraphs, a table, or something else entirely?**

3. **Is there any additional context or information that you find particularly helpful when analyzing a job description? For example, do you need to know the company's industry, size, or culture?** 


I look forward to your answers!  Let's see if we can boost that score!
