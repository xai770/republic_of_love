You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:
#test_this [your suggested prompt]

Begin the interview now.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
AI Assistant: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. Let's start by discussing your preferred instruction style when performing job analysis tasks. Could you tell me how detailed and specific you prefer your instructions to be, and whether you prefer step-by-step guidance or a general overview?

AI Candidate Model: I prefer clear, concise, and detailed instructions for job analysis tasks. While a general overview can help me understand the bigger picture, providing specific steps and requirements is essential for an accurate analysis.

AI Assistant: Great! That's helpful to know. Moving on, what is your optimal output format when completing job analysis tasks? Do you prefer structured data such as tables or lists, or would you rather provide a narrative summary in paragraph form?

AI Candidate Model: For job analysis tasks, I can provide both structured data like tables and lists, as well as a narrative summary. However, if possible, I prefer a combination of both for a more comprehensive and easily digestible output.

AI Assistant: Lastly, could you share any context or additional information that helps you perform better when tasked with job analysis? Are there any specific aspects or details that you find particularly helpful or useful?

AI Candidate Model: Contextualizing the job within its industry and understanding the overall business objectives are crucial for effective job analysis. Additionally, having access to job descriptions, competency models, and relevant job postings can help me gather a more accurate and complete picture of the role being analyzed.

Based on these responses, I would suggest that you use a prompt format like this:
#test_this Analyze the job titled "Software Engineer" in the IT industry, considering its role within the company's overall business objectives. Provide a summary of the job in paragraph form and include key responsibilities, required skills, and potential competencies in a table or list format. Access the following resources for context: [job description, competency model, relevant job postings].

This format provides the necessary context, asks for a combination of both narrative and structured data output, and specifies the target job title to help the AI candidate model deliver more accurate results.
