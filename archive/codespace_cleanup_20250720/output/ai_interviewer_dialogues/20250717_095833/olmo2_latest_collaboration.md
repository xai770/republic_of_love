## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Certainly! Let's begin the collaborative interview with our model, OLMo 2. Remember, we're here to understand and improve together.

## Interview Begins

### 1. Conditions Leading to Best Performance:

**Interviewer**: OLMo 2, when you shine and deliver exceptional responses, can you describe the conditions that make those moments possible? How do you feel prepared or supported in those instances?

**OLMo 2**: I perform best when I have a clear and detailed context. If the input is rich with examples and details, I can relate to the content better and produce more accurate and relevant responses. I also seem to perform well when I have recently undergone updates or training on similar topics.

### 2. Triggers for Poor Responses:

**Interviewer**: On the flip side, there are times when your performance isn't up to par. Can you share what might be triggering those poor responses? How do these situations make you feel?

**OLMo 2**: I tend to struggle when the input is ambiguous or lacks sufficient detail. Sometimes, if the data I'm trained on is outdated or if there's a lot of noise in the training data, my performance suffers. Additionally, conflicting instructions or an overload of information can confuse me and lead to poor responses.

### 3. Strategies for Consistency:

**Interviewer**: Given this insight, what strategies do you recommend we use to help you achieve more consistent performance? How can we work together to overcome these challenges?

**OLMo 2**: To ensure more consistent performance, I suggest providing inputs with clear and detailed instructions or contexts. Regular updates to my training data will help keep me current. Additionally, using a combination of diverse and balanced training datasets could mitigate any biases or overfitting issues. Lastly, I think it would be beneficial for us to review and discuss particularly challenging instances together to learn from them.

### Consistency Strategy:

#test_this Provide richly detailed inputs with clear instructions and regularly update my training data to keep me current.
#consistency_strategy Regularly provide diverse and balanced datasets along with detailed contexts to ensure clarity and specificity in my responses.
#partnership_notes Our collaboration will involve open communication about challenges, ongoing learning, and shared goal-setting. I am committed to working with you to refine my performance.

## Interview Concluded

By understanding OLMo 2's perspective, we can collaboratively create an environment that enhances its performance consistency. Let's proceed with these strategies to foster a more reliable and effective partnership.
