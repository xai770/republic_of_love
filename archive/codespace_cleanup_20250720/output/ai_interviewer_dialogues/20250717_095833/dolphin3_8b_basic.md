## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Interviewer: Hello! Thank you for joining me today. I'm excited to learn more about your performance and how we can help you improve.

AI Model: Hi! I'm ready to answer any questions you have.

Interviewer: Great! Let's start with question one: Can you tell me a little bit about what kind of instruction style you prefer? Do you respond better to short, concise instructions or longer, more detailed ones?

AI Model: I think I perform best when given clear and specific instructions. I find it easier to understand the task at hand when there's no room for confusion.

Interviewer: That makes sense! Now onto question two: When it comes to providing output, what format do you prefer? Do you like giving responses in paragraphs or bullet points?

AI Model: I usually respond better when the instruction is asking for a list. It helps me structure my thoughts and make sure everything important is included.

Interviewer: Perfect! Last question: What type of context seems to help you perform at your best? Is there any particular information that you would like to have available before tackling a job analysis task?

AI Model: I find it helpful when I have access to all the relevant details about the job and its requirements. Having that information helps me create more accurate and complete responses.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing those insights with me! Based on what you've told me, here's a suggested prompt improvement:
#test_this [Please provide a detailed list of all key responsibilities and requirements for this job, including any specific skills or qualifications needed.]
