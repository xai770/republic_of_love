## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.

##  Diagnostic Interview: codegemma:2B & Job Requirement Extraction

**Objective:** Identify the root cause of codegemma:2B's performance issues in job requirement extraction (4.2/10).

**Approach:** A structured conversation focusing on specific examples and probing for underlying reasons behind its weaknesses.

**Conversation Structure:**

1. **Warm-up:** Start with a simple, well-defined job description to assess baseline performance.
    *  "Analyze this job posting and extract the required skills, salary range, and work location: [Insert clear, concise job description]" 
2. **Technical Skill Identification:** Focus on job descriptions emphasizing technical skills. 
    * "This posting requires expertise in Python, SQL, and cloud computing. Can you list all the specific technologies mentioned?"  Analyze for accuracy and completeness.
3. **Salary Range Analysis:** Present job descriptions with diverse salary ranges (wide and narrow).
    * "What is the expected salary range for this position? [Insert job description with clear salary information]" Analyze for vagueness or inconsistency.
4. **Remote Work Preference Detection:** Include job descriptions explicitly stating remote work preferences.
    * "Is this a fully remote position? [Insert job description mentioning remote work preference]" Analyze for accurate detection and reporting.

**Probing Questions:**

Throughout the interview, use probing questions to understand the model's reasoning:

* "How did you arrive at that salary range?" 
* "What information led you to conclude this about remote work?"
* "Can you explain your reasoning behind missing [specific technical skill]?"

**Response Time Analysis:**  Track response times for each question to identify potential bottlenecks.


## Proposed Solution:

#test_this  

"Analyze the following job description and extract the following information: 

1. **Required Skills:** List all specific technical skills mentioned in the description.
2. **Salary Range:** Provide a realistic salary range based on the information given. Be as specific as possible.
3. **Work Location:** State whether the position is remote, in-office, or hybrid. Justify your answer based on the provided details.

[Insert clear, concise job description emphasizing technical skills, salary range ambiguity, and work location preference]


#confidence_level 8/10

#reasoning:

This approach combines a specific prompt with carefully chosen examples to pinpoint the model's weaknesses.  Analyzing its responses to each section allows for targeted feedback and identification of the root cause:

* **Prompt Specificity:**  The prompt clearly defines expectations, reducing ambiguity and potential misinterpretations.
* **Targeted Examples:** The job descriptions are designed to highlight specific areas of weakness (technical skills, salary ranges, remote work).
* **Reasoning Analysis:** Asking for justifications forces the model to articulate its thought process, revealing potential biases or limitations in its understanding.

While this approach provides valuable insights, further fine-tuning and data augmentation may be required to significantly improve codegemma:2B's performance in job requirement extraction.
