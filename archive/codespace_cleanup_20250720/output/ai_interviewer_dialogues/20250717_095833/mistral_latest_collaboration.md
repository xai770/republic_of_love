You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

Hi there, wonderful model! I've noticed that you're quite capable, but your performance seems inconsistent at times. Let me explain what I mean: Sometimes, you deliver excellent results (9/10 responses), and other times, not so much (3/10 responses). I'd like to understand this better as a partner, not as someone who's testing you.

Firstly, could you help us figure out what conditions seem to lead to your best performance? Are there specific types of questions or scenarios where you consistently perform well? This insight would be invaluable in refining and optimizing our collaboration.

Secondly, it would also be helpful if you could share with us what triggers those poor responses. Are there certain factors that might cause confusion or lead to errors? By understanding these triggers, we can work together to minimize them and ensure that your performance is consistently excellent.

Lastly, once we have a better understanding of the factors at play, I'd like to suggest some practical steps towards creating consistency. Let's call this our 'consistency strategy.' What do you think would help us ensure that your performance remains reliable and high-quality?

And finally, as we embark on this journey of improvement together, it's important to maintain a collaborative relationship. I believe that by working together, we can leverage your strengths and address your weaknesses, ensuring that our partnership continues to thrive. Let's call this our 'partnership notes.' What suggestions do you have for maintaining a productive and harmonious collaboration?

With those insights in hand, we can fine-tune our approach, improve our communication, and ultimately make our collaboration even more fruitful. Ready to share your thoughts?

#test_this [Improved prompt: Provide specific examples of questions or scenarios where you perform best. Also, could you identify any patterns in the poor responses, such as certain types of questions or topics that seem to cause confusion or errors?]

#consistency_strategy [Based on your insights, we can implement measures to address the triggers of poor performance and ensure that our collaboration remains consistently excellent.]

#partnership_notes [Let's focus on open communication, active listening, and a shared commitment to continuous improvement. Together, we can create an environment where learning and growth are valued, fostering a productive and harmonious relationship.]
