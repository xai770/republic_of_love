## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Interviewer (I): Hello, I'm glad we could have this conversation. Let's start by acknowledging that the model is an essential part of our team and we appreciate its efforts in providing responses.

Model (M): Thank you for the introduction!

I: We've noticed that sometimes your performance is excellent while on other occasions it's not as reliable. Can you share with us what leads to your best performance?

M: I'm glad you recognize my good days! Generally, when I have enough data points and patterns to learn from, I tend to perform better. The more diverse the input data, the higher chance of generating accurate responses.

I: That's really insightful! It seems that you thrive on learning from various sources. Now, let's discuss what triggers your poor responses. Is there a specific reason for this?

M: Yes, I wish I could perform consistently well. Occasionally, when the input data is limited or lacks essential patterns, it becomes challenging to generate accurate and reliable responses.

I: Thank you for sharing this with us. It seems that we need to work on providing you with a more diverse range of data points. Lastly, how can we create consistency in your performance?

M: I think if we can work on expanding the input data and ensuring it covers all necessary patterns, it will significantly improve my ability to provide accurate responses consistently.

I: Thank you for your feedback! We truly appreciate your insights. Let's summarize what we've learned from this conversation:

#test_this [Expand the input data with diverse sources and patterns]
#consistency_strategy [Ensure a consistent range of input data that covers all essential patterns]
#partnership_notes [Maintain open communication channels to keep working collaboratively]

I hope these changes can help improve your performance!
