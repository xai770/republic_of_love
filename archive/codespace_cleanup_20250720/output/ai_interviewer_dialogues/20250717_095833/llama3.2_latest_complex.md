**Model:** llama3.2:latest
**Scenario:** complex

**Duration:** 10.2s
**Status:** success
**Overall Score:** 6.6/10

## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
To identify the root cause of the candidate model's struggles with job requirement extraction, I would design a diagnostic interview that combines specific tests to reveal the model's strengths and weaknesses.

**Test 1: Technical Requirements Extraction**

I'll provide a short job description with clear technical requirements and ask the model to extract them. If it consistently fails to identify key requirements or provides vague answers, it may indicate a prompting issue (e.g., unclear prompt design) or context limitation (e.g., inadequate training data).

**Test 2: Salary Range Estimation**

I'll provide two job descriptions with varying levels of detail on salary ranges and ask the model to estimate the range for each position. If it consistently provides wide or vague estimates, it may indicate a lack of understanding of contextual factors that influence salary (e.g., industry standards, location).

**Test 3: Remote Work Preferences**

I'll provide two job descriptions with clear remote work preferences and ask the model to identify whether each position requires remote work. If it consistently fails to detect remote work requirements or makes incorrect assumptions, it may indicate a limitation in understanding contextual factors (e.g., company culture, industry norms).

**Test 4: Response Time Analysis**

I'll simulate various scenarios to test the model's response time variability and ask for explanations of why its responses differ. If it provides plausible but inconsistent reasons, it may indicate an internal process that requires improvement (e.g., prioritization, resource allocation).

To structure a conversation, I would follow these steps:

1. Introduce the interview format: Explain that we'll be conducting a structured conversation to gather data on the model's strengths and weaknesses.
2. Present each test: Clearly explain the purpose of each test and provide examples to demonstrate the desired output.
3. Encourage explanation: After presenting each test, ask the model to provide explanations for its responses. This will help identify patterns in its thought process and potential biases.
4. Gather feedback: Use the model's own feedback to refine our understanding of its capabilities and limitations.

Let's begin the diagnostic interview!

**Test 1: Technical Requirements Extraction**

Can you extract the technical requirements from this job description:

"Seeking a skilled full-stack developer with experience in JavaScript, React, and Node.js. The ideal candidate should have a strong understanding of backend development and be able to work collaboratively with cross-functional teams."

Please provide the technical requirements for this position.

**#test_this**
Can you extract the technical requirements from this job description?

**#confidence_level** 8/10 (I'm moderately confident that this test will reveal some insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.)

**#reasoning**

This test aims to evaluate the model's ability to identify key technical requirements. By providing a clear job description, I can assess whether the model understands the context and can extract relevant information. If it consistently fails to do so, it may indicate a prompting issue or context limitation.
