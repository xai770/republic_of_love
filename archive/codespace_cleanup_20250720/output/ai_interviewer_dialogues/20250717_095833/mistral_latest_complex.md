# AI Interviewer Dialogue: mistral:latest - complex

**Model:** mistral:latest
**Scenario:** complex
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-17T10:22:01.608406
**Duration:** 17.7s
**Status:** success
**Overall Score:** 5.2/10

## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.
```

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
#test_this In order to diagnose the performance issues with the codegemma:2b model, let's design a series of tests and a structured conversation. Here is an example of how we can structure our diagnostic interview:

**1. Testing approach:**

- **Technical requirement extraction test:** Present the model with a job posting containing various technical requirements and ask it to identify and extract them. Compare its performance against a baseline model or a human annotator to assess the accuracy and completeness of its extractions.

- **Salary range test:** Provide the model with job postings that include salary ranges, ask it to estimate the salary for similar positions, and compare its responses to the actual salary ranges provided in the job postings.

- **Remote work preference test:** Present the model with job postings containing remote work options and assess if it accurately identifies and prioritizes them over on-site requirements.

- **Response time test:** Measure the average response time of the model when given a set of standardized prompts to analyze its consistency in delivering responses within a reasonable timeframe.

**2. Structured conversation:** To gather actionable data, we can structure our conversation as follows:

1. Greeting and introduction
2. Presenting a job posting with known technical requirements, salary range, and remote work preferences (if applicable)
3. Asking the model to identify and extract the technical requirements, estimate the salary for similar positions, and indicate if remote work is available or preferred
4. Evaluating the model's responses against the baseline or human annotator and providing feedback on its performance
5. Repeating steps 2-4 with multiple job postings to assess consistency in its results
6. Asking for clarification on any unclear or incorrect responses, if necessary
7. Concluding the conversation by summarizing the findings and discussing potential solutions to improve the model's performance

**3. Confidence level:** 8/10 - This approach is well-structured and should provide valuable insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses. By comparing its performance against a baseline or human annotator, we can identify specific areas where improvements are needed.

**4. Reasoning:** The tests and structured conversation outlined above will allow us to evaluate the model's performance in various aspects such as technical requirement extraction, salary estimation, remote work preference identification, and response time consistency. By repeating these tests with multiple job postings, we can assess its overall performance and consistency across different scenarios. Additionally, the feedback provided during the conversation will help identify any specific areas that require improvement, enabling us to develop targeted solutions to address the challenges faced by the codegemma:2b model.
