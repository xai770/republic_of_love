## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.
```

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Interviewer: Thank you for agreeing to participate in this diagnostic interview, model codegemma:2b. I'm here to understand why you're struggling with job requirement extraction and how we can improve your performance. Let's start by discussing the areas where you scored low.

1. Can you tell me more about the technical requirements you missed? Was it a prompting issue or a limitation in understanding context?

2. You provided vague salary ranges in some cases. Is this due to a lack of information in the prompts, or is there something else going on here?

3. When it comes to remote work preferences, why did you often ignore these details?

4. The response time varies significantly - what do you think could be causing these inconsistencies?

Once we've discussed these areas, I'd like to conduct some specific tests to help us understand your strengths and weaknesses better. We'll also have a conversation that gathers actionable data for potential improvements.

After our interview and testing, I will provide an optimized prompt and explain my reasoning behind it.

Let's get started!

#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]
```
