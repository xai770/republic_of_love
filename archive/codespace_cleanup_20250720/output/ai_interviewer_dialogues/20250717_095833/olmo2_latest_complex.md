# AI Interviewer Dialogue: olmo2:latest - complex

**Model:** olmo2:latest
**Scenario:** complex
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-17T10:19:28.323514
**Duration:** 8.2s
**Status:** success
**Overall Score:** 5.8/10

## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.
```

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
#test_this Ask the model: "Can you list the top three technical skills required for a Software Developer position based on industry standards?" 
#confidence_level 7
#reasoning This prompt tests the model's ability to extract specific information from predefined categories (in this case, job requirements), which is a fundamental skill expected from a candidate in a recruitment context. It also directly addresses the issue of vague salary ranges and remote work preferences by focusing on technical skills rather than economic or personal preferences. The variability in response time can be separately observed during the course of the interview.
