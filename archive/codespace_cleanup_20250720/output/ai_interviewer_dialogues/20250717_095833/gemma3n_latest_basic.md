Okay, let's begin the interview.

"Hello! Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I'm an optimization specialist, and I'm working to help you improve your performance on job analysis tasks. I understand you're currently scoring around 4.2/10, and we want to see how we can boost that.

To start, I'd like to ask you a few questions about how you best receive instructions and what helps you generate the most accurate and complete responses. Your answers will help me craft more effective prompts for you.

First question: **When you're given a task like job analysis, do you perform better with concise, direct instructions, or do you benefit from more detailed explanations and background information?**"

(Waiting for imaginary response...)

---

**(Assuming the model responds with something like: "I think I perform better with more detailed explanations and background information. I sometimes miss nuances if the instructions are too brief.")**

"That's very helpful, thank you.

Second question: **How would you prefer to present your analysis? Would you prefer a structured format like bullet points, a table, or a more narrative paragraph?**"

(Waiting for imaginary response...)

---

**(Assuming the model responds with something like: "A structured format, like bullet points or a table, is definitely better. It helps me organize my thoughts and ensure I cover all the key areas.")**

"Excellent. And finally: **Are there any specific types of context or examples that consistently help you generate more thorough and insightful job analyses? For instance, providing examples of well-analyzed jobs or outlining the desired level of detail would be beneficial?**"

(Waiting for imaginary response...)

---

**(Assuming the model responds with something like: "Yes, examples of well-analyzed jobs are really helpful. Seeing how other jobs have been broken down gives me a clear framework to follow. Also, specifying the target audience for the analysis helps me tailor the level of detail.")**
