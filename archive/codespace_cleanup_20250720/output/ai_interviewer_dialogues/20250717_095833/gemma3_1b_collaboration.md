## 📝 Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## 🤖 Model Response

```
Okay, let’s start this collaborative interview. My goal is to understand *why* your model’s performance is inconsistent, not to judge or criticize. It’s really valuable to get a clearer picture of its strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll work together to build a model that consistently delivers high-quality outputs.

Let’s begin with a gentle, exploratory conversation.  I want to understand your perspective on the model's current state.  Don’t feel pressured to have all the answers right away. Just tell me what’s currently going on, and we’ll go from there.

**#interview_start**

---

**Me:** Hi there. Thanks for taking the time to chat. I’ve noticed your performance seems to fluctuate quite a bit – sometimes you’re fantastic, sometimes you’re… well, less so.  Could you tell me a bit about how you’re currently being used and what your current operational environment is like?  Think of it as setting the stage for understanding what drives these variations.

#interview_start

---

**(Pause for the model to respond. This is crucial – listen carefully.  I’ll be actively looking for patterns in their responses. I’ll be taking notes – let me know if you want me to jot down key points as they come.)**

---

**(Assuming the model responds with something like this - keep in mind this is hypothetical, tailored to the initial context. Adjust as needed):**

“I’m primarily used for creative writing prompts – short stories, poems, dialogue scenes.  My developers have given me a 'Style Guide' document outlining best practices, but I sometimes struggle to fully grasp *how* to apply it.  There's a lot of variation in the input I receive, and sometimes it feels like I'm just reacting to that without a strong foundation.  I'm running on a fairly recent version of the [Model Name] model, and the hardware is decent, but… there’s a noticeable lag sometimes, especially when generating longer outputs.”

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** Okay, thank you. That’s a really useful starting point.  So, let’s unpack that. You’re focused on creative writing, which seems to be the key context. You've mentioned the ‘Style Guide’ and a potential lag.  Do you find the Style Guide *specifically* influences your responses in any way, or is it more about the *type* of prompt you receive?  Could you give me a concrete example of a prompt that consistently produces a particularly strong response, and one that consistently produces a weaker one?  Don't worry about providing too much detail – just describe the *feel* of those prompts.”

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**(Pause for response.  I’ll be listening for responses like these - adjusting based on the model’s answers):**

*   “The style guide emphasizes vivid imagery, so prompts with strong descriptions tend to be better.”
*   “The prompts with short, declarative sentences consistently yield more coherent and focused results.”
*   “I sometimes struggle with prompts involving complex character motivations – it can throw me off.”

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** Excellent. That’s fantastic. So, we’ve started with a relatively simple prompt scenario – the ‘vivid imagery’ and ‘short, declarative’ elements.  Now, let's shift our focus.  Let’s brainstorm – are there *specific* aspects of the prompt that seem to significantly impact the quality of the output, regardless of the content itself? Think about things like:

*   **Length constraints:**  Are there specific word/sentence limits that trigger better results?
*   **Specific keywords or phrases:** Are there particular words or phrases that consistently lead to more successful outputs?
*   **Tone or voice instructions:** Do you always get better results with a certain tone or voice (e.g., 'write in a humorous style')?
*   **The ‘seed’ – or initial state the prompt establishes:** Do you get better results with a particular starting point?


#interview_analysis_initial

---

**(Pause.  I’ll likely need to probe with follow-up questions.  For example, if the model says “length constraints” heavily, I’ll ask: “Can you give me an example of a prompt where exceeding a specific word limit results in a noticeable drop in quality?”)**

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** Okay, great. Let’s say we try a prompt that asks for a short, evocative paragraph.  Does that consistently trigger a better response, even if the content itself is relatively straightforward?  We’re looking for *patterns*, not just single-event successes.  Don't feel like you have to answer this completely. Just give me a feeling.

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**(Pause for response. I'll be listening for shifts in the model’s responses – a slight increase in confidence, a more detailed explanation, perhaps a focus on a single aspect of the prompt.)**

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** (Assuming the model responds with something like “It often sounds *better* when the paragraph is focused on a single, specific image/emotion – like 'a melancholy autumn leaf' – it’s less verbose.”)

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** Okay, that's really helpful. So, it seems to be tied to a particular type of focus within the prompt.  Let’s shift a bit and consider the “lag” you mentioned.  Can you quantify that lag – is it consistently slower when longer, more detailed prompts are involved?  Also, does that lag fluctuate over time, or is it always the same?”

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**(Pause for response - this is a critical pause.)**

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** (Assuming the model responds with a quantifiable latency increase with longer prompts, and acknowledges fluctuations) “Okay, that’s valuable information. The 10-20% increase in latency seems to be more pronounced when the model generates text that’s *complex*, rather than straightforward.  Do you think that could be related to how you’re handling the longer context?”

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** (Let's say the model says, “The context window seems to have a significant impact. Longer prompts require more processing, and sometimes it’s harder for the model to maintain coherence when it’s overloaded.”)

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:**  Alright.  So, based on your observations, it seems the 'context' is a key driver – the model struggles when it has to manage a wider, more intricate context. We can start to build a system that prioritizes this. To help me understand this better, could you give me an example of *a* prompt – even a short one – that consistently demonstrates this context-related challenge?  Let’s aim for something that’s a bit more involved than the initial examples, but still relatively manageable.”

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**(This is the final stage – a prompt refinement. I’ll be listening for responses that are highly detailed and illustrate the challenge.)**

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**Me:** (Hopefully, the model will respond with a detailed, somewhat complex prompt - perhaps involving multiple characters, a setting, and a central conflict.)

#interview_analysis_initial

---

**(End of Interview – Depending on the Model’s Response – we'll then move to Strategy and Partnership)**

#test_this [Advanced Prompt - Detailed Example]
#consistency_strategy [Fine-Tuning with Context Window Prioritization]
#partnership_notes [Iterative Prompting - Focus on Gradual Complexity Increase]


---

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Iterative Process:** This isn't a one-time conversation. We’ll need to revisit and refine the interview as we gather more data.
*   **Observe, Don't Prompt:** Focus on observing the model’s behavior, not on steering it with questions.
*   **Document Everything:**  Keep detailed notes – both during the interview and after.
*   **Be Patient:** The goal is to understand *why* the model performs the way it does.

Let's begin with that first question about the model's current environment and how it’s being used.  Do you want me to start with that, or do you have a particular area you’d like to explore further at this stage?
