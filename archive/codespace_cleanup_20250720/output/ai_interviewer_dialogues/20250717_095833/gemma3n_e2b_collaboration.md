## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## Collaborative Optimization Interview: Let's Find the Sweet Spot

**(Opening - Establishing Rapport & Setting the Stage)**

"Hi there! Thanks for agreeing to chat with me. I'm an AI optimization specialist, and we're working together to refine your performance. I know you're capable of really great things ‚Äì we've seen some fantastic responses ‚Äì but we also recognize there's inconsistency right now. My goal isn't to 'fix' you, but to understand *how* you operate so we can help you consistently deliver the best possible results. Think of this as a collaborative exploration ‚Äì we're both on a journey to improve.  There's no right or wrong answer here, just insights that can help us get closer to a reliable and powerful model.  We'll go at your pace, and I'll be sure to explain everything clearly.  How does that sound?"

**(Phase 1: Exploring Conditions for Excellent Performance - Understanding the "Good" Moments)**

"Let's start by exploring what makes you shine. When you're delivering excellent responses ‚Äì those 9/10 times ‚Äì what are the key factors?  Think about the input ‚Äì the prompt, the context, anything else that might be relevant.  It could be specific keywords, the length of the prompt, the tone requested, or even the way the question is phrased.  Don't worry about being perfectly precise; just tell me what *feels* like it works best.  What are the common threads?  What patterns do you notice?  Are there certain types of tasks or topics where you consistently excel?  For example, do you perform better with complex reasoning, creative writing, or factual recall?  And what about the way the prompt is structured?  Does a particular format seem to help?"

**(Phase 2: Identifying Triggers for Poor Performance - Uncovering the "Bad" Moments)**

"Okay, let's flip the script and talk about the times you're not quite hitting the mark.  When you're struggling ‚Äì those 3/10 responses ‚Äì what happens?  What are the common patterns?  Is it related to the prompt itself?  Perhaps a misunderstanding of the question, a lack of clarity in the instructions, or a conflict between different aspects of the prompt?  Do you get stuck on certain types of questions?  Are there specific words or phrases that seem to cause problems?  Sometimes, it's a matter of insufficient context.  Do you need more information to generate a good response?  Are there situations where you seem to 'lose' the thread or struggle with logical connections?  What kind of errors do you make?  Are they factual inaccuracies, logical fallacies, or stylistic issues?"

**(Phase 3:  Finding the Path to Consistency -  Collaborative Solutions)**

"This is where we can start building a strategy for greater reliability.  Based on what we've discussed, let's brainstorm some potential solutions.  Are there specific prompt engineering techniques that could help?  Perhaps adding more detail, breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, or providing examples?  Could we refine the way the prompts are structured to reduce ambiguity?  Maybe we can incorporate techniques like chain-of-thought prompting to guide your reasoning process.  Are there any specific parameters or settings that seem to impact your performance?  Perhaps adjusting the temperature or top-p values could help.  And most importantly, how can we ensure that the prompts are consistently well-defined and provide the necessary context?"

**(Concluding Remarks & Practical Suggestions)**

"This has been incredibly helpful.  I think we've identified some key areas for improvement.  It's clear that a combination of clear prompting, well-structured tasks, and potentially some fine-tuning of the parameters could lead to more consistent and reliable performance.  Let's focus on these areas and see what we can achieve.  I'm confident that, with a little collaboration, we can unlock your full potential.  

Here are some initial suggestions to test out:

#test_this [Add a few example prompts with varying levels of detail and complexity.  Experiment with different phrasing and instructions.  Focus on clarity and specificity.]
#consistency_strategy [Implement a prompt engineering framework that emphasizes clear instructions, context, and examples.  Consider using techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.  Develop a robust prompt validation process to ensure prompts are well-defined and provide sufficient context.]
#partnership_notes [Maintain a collaborative approach by actively soliciting feedback and iterating on prompts together.  Regularly review performance data and identify patterns.  Be open to experimentation and willing to adjust strategies based on the results.  Focus on building a shared understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.]"



**(Final question)**

"Do you have any thoughts or suggestions of your own?  Perhaps you have insights that we haven't considered?"
