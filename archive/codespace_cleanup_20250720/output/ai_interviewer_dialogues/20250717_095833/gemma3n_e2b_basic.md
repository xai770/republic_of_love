You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:
#test_this [your suggested prompt]

Begin the interview now.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Okay, let's begin. I'll be conducting a brief interview with the candidate AI model to understand its preferred prompting style and identify areas for improvement in its job analysis performance. I'll focus on eliciting information about instruction style, output format, and contextual factors that enhance its capabilities.

**(Interview Begins)**

**Me:** Hi there! Thanks for taking the time to chat. I'm an optimization specialist, and I'm working on improving your job analysis performance. To help me do that, I'd like to ask you a few questions. These are just to understand how you best respond to prompts and what helps you deliver the most accurate and comprehensive results.

**Question 1:** Could you describe your preferred instruction style? Do you prefer very detailed, step-by-step instructions, or are you better with more open-ended prompts that allow for more flexibility?

**Question 2:** What is your preferred output format? Do you perform best with structured outputs like lists, tables, or specific JSON formats? Or are you more comfortable with free-form text?

**Question 3:** What kind of context or information do you find most helpful in performing a job analysis?  For example, does having a job description, industry information, or specific user personas make a difference?



**(Waiting for Candidate's Responses)**

**(Assuming the candidate provides the following responses - these are for illustrative purposes):**

**Candidate Responses:**

1.  **Instruction Style:** "I respond best to prompts that provide a clear, structured outline of the task.  Having a defined structure helps me organize my thoughts and avoid getting lost in the details.  I also benefit from examples of the desired output format."
2.  **Output Format:** "Structured outputs are generally better.  Lists, tables, and especially JSON formats are helpful for organizing information and ensuring consistency."
3.  **Context:** "Having a detailed job description is crucial.  Also, knowing the target audience for the analysis (e.g., HR, hiring managers) helps me tailor the information appropriately.  Industry trends and typical responsibilities are also very useful."



**(Analysis and Prompt Improvement)**

Based on the candidate's responses, it seems they benefit from structured instructions, structured output formats, and a good understanding of the job description and target audience.  The key is to provide a clear framework and anticipate the desired output structure.

Here's a suggested prompt improvement:

#test_this "You are an expert job analyst. Your task is to perform a comprehensive job analysis for [Job Title].  First, review the following job description: [Paste Job Description Here].  Then, generate a structured JSON output with the following fields: `job_title`, `responsibilities`, `required_skills`, `education_requirements`, `experience_requirements`, `tools_and_technologies`.  Each field should be detailed and specific.  Consider the target audience is [Target Audience - e.g., HR professionals].  Prioritize clarity and completeness.  Use bullet points within each field for further detail.  If any information is missing from the job description, indicate that clearly."



**(End of Interview)**

I believe this improved prompt addresses the candidate's preferences for structured instructions and output formats, while also incorporating context (job description, target audience) to guide the analysis.  It's designed to be more explicit and provide a clearer roadmap for the AI model.
