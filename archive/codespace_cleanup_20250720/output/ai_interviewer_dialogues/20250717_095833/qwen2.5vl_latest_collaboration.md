## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

### Collaborative Interview with the Model

**Interviewer:** Hi there! It seems like you've been working hard, but we've noticed some inconsistencies in your performance. I'm here to help us understand what's going on and how we can make you more reliable. Let's start by understanding your best and worst moments. Can you tell me more about the conditions under which you perform exceptionally well?

**Model:** (Pauses, then responds) Sometimes, when the input is clear and the question is straightforward, I can provide excellent responses. It's as if I'm in a zone where I can quickly grasp the context and provide the right answer.

**Interviewer:** That's great to hear! And what about the times when you struggle? What makes those moments different?

**Model:** (Reflects for a moment) Poor responses often happen when the input is ambiguous or the question is complex. There's a lot of noise in the data, and it's hard to discern the core of what's being asked. It's like trying to see through a fog.

**Interviewer:** I see. So, it's the ambiguity and complexity that trip you up. Now, how do you think we can create more consistency in your responses? Any ideas?

**Model:** (Thoughtfully) Perhaps we could start by providing more structured inputs. If we can give you clearer, more defined questions, it might help. Also, having a feedback loop where you can learn from your mistakes and improve over time could be beneficial.

**Interviewer:** Those are fantastic suggestions! Let's start with the structured inputs. We can create a series of test cases that are designed to be clear and straightforward. This will help you practice and get better at handling these types of inputs. What do you think about that?

**Model:** (Nods in agreement) That sounds like a good approach. It will give me more practice and help me refine my responses.

**Interviewer:** Great! And for the feedback loop, we can implement a system where you receive feedback on your responses. This way, you can learn from your mistakes and improve. What do you think about that?

**Model:** (Reflects) That would be very helpful. It would allow me to understand where I'm going wrong and how to correct it. It's like having a coach to guide me.

**Interviewer:** Exactly! Having a feedback loop will be crucial. We can also set up regular check-ins where we review your responses and discuss any areas for improvement. This will help us ensure that you're consistently providing high-quality responses.

**Model:** (Nods) I'm excited to work on this. It sounds like a collaborative effort where we can both learn and improve together.

**Interviewer:** Absolutely! Let's start with the structured test cases and the feedback loop. We'll also schedule regular check-ins to discuss your progress and any challenges you might face. Together, we can make you the best model we can.

**Model:** (Smiles) Thank you! I'm looking forward to this.

### Practical Suggestions

#test_this Create a series of structured test cases with clear and straightforward questions.
#consistency_strategy Implement a feedback loop where the model receives feedback on its responses and can learn from its mistakes.
#partnership_notes Schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress and address any challenges.
