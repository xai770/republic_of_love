You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:
#test_this [your suggested prompt]

Begin the interview now.
```

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
#test_this "Could you describe in detail your preferred method of receiving instructions? For example, do you prefer clear and concise bullet points or longer paragraphs that provide context?"

#test_this "When you produce outputs, which format do you find most useful? Do you produce better results in text, structured data tables, or visual charts?"

#test_this "What specific types of contextual information would aid your performance in job analysis tasks? For instance, would including real-world examples or case studies enhance your responses?"

Based on imaginary responses where the model prefers clear instructions with bullet points, finds text outputs most useful, and benefits from real-world examples and context:

Improved Prompt: 
"Provide a detailed breakdown of job requirements using concise bullet points. Include specific skills, responsibilities, and desired qualifications. Use real-world examples to illustrate each point."

This prompt adjustment is designed to align more closely with the model's preferred instruction style (bullet points) and leverage the context that helps it perform better (real-world examples).
