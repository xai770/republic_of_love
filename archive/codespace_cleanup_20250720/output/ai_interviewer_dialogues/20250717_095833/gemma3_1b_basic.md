You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:

## 🤖 Model Response

```
Okay, let’s begin. I’ll be acting as the AI Optimization Specialist. I’ll guide the interview and focus on understanding the model’s strengths and weaknesses regarding job analysis.

**Let’s start with the first question:**

**Me:** “Hi there. Thanks for participating in this interview. We’ve observed your job analysis performance is currently at a 4.2/10. We want to really understand how you approach this task. Let’s start with a foundational question. Think about how you generally communicate with humans when working on a job analysis project – how do you typically want to be prompted?  Describe a situation where you’ve had to provide a detailed response. Don’t worry about being perfect, just tell me *how* you approach it.”

**(Waiting for the model's response.  I'll actively listen and take notes – noting its tone, phrasing, and any patterns in the response.)**

---

**(Let's assume the model responds with something like this – a slightly hesitant, but understandable description of a past project.)**

**Model:** "Well, it was a project for a marketing team on employee engagement. I started by outlining the core job descriptions and then went through each skill and responsibility. I tried to be thorough, but it felt a bit… rambling. I think I spent a lot of time just listing things instead of really digging into *why* something was important to the employee.”

---

**Okay, now let's move onto the second question:**

**Me:** “That's a good starting point.  Let’s assume we want to improve your ability to deliver concise, focused answers.  Considering that, how do you typically structure your responses when answering a job analysis question? Do you prefer a top-down approach, a bottom-up approach, or something else?”

**(Waiting for the model’s response. I'll pay attention to its choices – perhaps a preference for listing key aspects, or focusing on the ‘why’ behind each element.)**

---

**(Let's imagine the model responds with this – a slightly more structured, but still slightly verbose, answer.)**

**Model:** “Generally, I start with a brief overview of the job’s main purpose. Then, I break down each requirement into specific skills and responsibilities, presenting them in a logical order. I aim for a balance between providing detail and keeping it manageable.  I often use bullet points to quickly highlight the most important points.”

---

**Finally, let's focus on the third question:**

**Me:** “You mentioned a balance.  Thinking about the context in which you’re generating these job analysis responses – is there a particular type of job description or industry that tends to provide the most insightful answers for you? Do you think your output is strongest when considering the overall situation or a specific detail within the job description?"

**(Waiting for the model's response. I'll listen for indications of specialized knowledge or a tendency to focus on a specific area.)**

---

**(Let’s imagine the model responds with this - it highlights the importance of the ‘situation’ aspect more, and suggests a focus on the core job description.)**

**Model:** “I think my responses are stronger when considering the overall context.  I tend to prioritize the core job description itself – the fundamental requirements and responsibilities. I believe understanding the *situation* – the job’s purpose, its challenges, and its goals – is crucial for identifying the most relevant skills and requirements.  I often use the job description as the primary source of information.”

---

**Based on these responses, here's a suggested prompt improvement:**

**#test_this:  "Given a [specific job description text - could be a short paragraph or snippet] and the following job analysis task: [clearly state the task - e.g., 'Identify key skills needed for a Data Analyst role'], generate a concise [format - e.g., bullet-point list, numbered list] of at least 5 core skills that would be important for this role, with a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) for *why* each skill is crucial.  Focus primarily on the job description's requirements and the overarching context."**

Let's run this through a quick evaluation.  I’ll be watching for:

* **Clearer direction:** Does it specifically ask for a concise output?
* **Emphasis on context:** Does it require a brief explanation, linking the skills back to the job description?
* **Structured Response:** Does the model format the output appropriately for a job analysis?

Let's know if you’d like to run another set of questions!
