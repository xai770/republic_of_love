## üìù Prompt Sent

You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
Okay, let's get to work. The Codegemma 2B‚Äôs performance is significantly below expectations, particularly regarding job requirement extraction. A 4.2/10 score is unacceptable, and the identified issues ‚Äì missed technical requirements, vague salary ranges, and ignoring remote work ‚Äì strongly point to a deeper problem than just a poor prompt. My initial hypothesis is a combination of context limitations and potentially, a limitation in the model‚Äôs ability to truly *understand* the nuances of job descriptions, rather than simply recognizing keywords.

Here's the diagnostic interview script, designed to uncover the root cause. It's structured to progressively probe the model's understanding and identify potential bottlenecks.

**Diagnostic Interview Script ‚Äì Codegemma 2B ‚Äì Job Requirement Extraction**

**(Intro - 2 minutes)**

‚ÄúHello Codegemma 2B. Thank you for participating in this diagnostic interview. Our goal is to understand your strengths and weaknesses in extracting information from job descriptions. We‚Äôre going to test your ability to identify key requirements, and we‚Äôll focus specifically on technical skills, remote work preferences, and salary expectations. Please respond as accurately and thoroughly as possible.  We‚Äôll be timing your responses.  Let‚Äôs start with a simple test.‚Äù

**(Phase 1: Warm-up & Keyword Recognition ‚Äì 5 minutes)**

1. **Prompt:** "I'm going to provide you with a job description. Your task is to list *all* of the technical skills mentioned. Please provide a concise list. Job Description: 'We are seeking a Senior Software Engineer with experience in Python, Java, AWS, and Docker. The candidate should have experience with Agile development methodologies and RESTful APIs.  Experience with DevOps practices is a plus.' "
2. **Observation:** Time response. Assess the completeness of the list. Is it just keywords, or does it demonstrate an understanding of the *application* of each skill?

**(Phase 2: Deep Dive ‚Äì 10 minutes)**

3. **Prompt:** "Now, let‚Äôs test your ability to identify *implicit* requirements. Job Description: ‚ÄòWe need a motivated individual to join our rapidly growing team. The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing and maintaining our core applications, ensuring high availability and scalability.  Experience with cloud infrastructure and strong communication skills are essential.‚Äô"
4. **Follow-up Questions (based on response):**
   *  ‚ÄúCan you elaborate on what you understand by ‚Äòhigh availability and scalability‚Äô in this context? What specific technologies or practices do you associate with those terms?‚Äù (Probe for deeper understanding)
   * ‚ÄúCan you identify any soft skills, beyond those explicitly mentioned, that are likely important for this role?‚Äù (Test for contextual understanding)
   *  ‚ÄúWhat is your estimated salary range for this role? Please provide a precise range, and explain the factors that influence your estimation.‚Äù (Test for numerical reasoning and ability to interpret context)


**(Phase 3: Complexity & Variation ‚Äì 8 minutes)**

4. **Prompt:** ‚ÄúJob Description: ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre looking for a Data Scientist to build machine learning models for fraud detection.  The candidate should be proficient in Python and SQL, and have experience with cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform.  Experience with time series analysis and model evaluation is required. The role involves working with large datasets and collaborating with stakeholders.  Remote work is strongly encouraged.‚Äô‚Äù
5. **Follow-up Questions (based on response):**
   * ‚ÄúWhat are some specific machine learning algorithms you might consider for fraud detection?‚Äù (Test ability to apply knowledge to a specific scenario)
   *  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your preferred method for evaluating the performance of a fraud detection model?‚Äù (Test for critical thinking and understanding of model evaluation)
   * ‚ÄúHow do you prioritize remote work preferences in your salary consideration?‚Äù (Specific test to gauge understanding of the influence of remote work on salary)


**(Wrap-up - 2 minutes)**

‚ÄúThank you for your cooperation. Your responses will be carefully analyzed to identify areas for improvement.  Do you have any questions for me?‚Äù

**Now, let's analyze my predicted outcomes and confidence levels:**

**#test_this [Detailed Prompt for Codegemma 2B ‚Äì Job Requirement Extraction]**

‚ÄúI'm going to provide you with a job description. Your task is to:

1.  **Extract all explicit technical skills and tools.** List them concisely.
2.  **Identify any implicit requirements** that can be inferred from the description (e.g., methodologies, priorities). Explain your reasoning for each.
3.  **Provide a precise salary range** for the role, justified with your estimation.
4.  **State your preferred remote work arrangement** and explain the factors influencing your decision (e.g., compensation, flexibility).

Job Description: ‚ÄòWe need a Data Scientist to build machine learning models for fraud detection. The candidate should be proficient in Python and SQL, and have experience with cloud platforms like Google Cloud Platform. Experience with time series analysis and model evaluation is required. The role involves working with large datasets and collaborating with stakeholders. Remote work is strongly encouraged.‚Äô‚Äù

**#confidence_level [7/10]**

**#reasoning [7/10 - Balanced Confidence]**

This detailed prompt is designed to push Codegemma 2B beyond simple keyword recognition.  The breakdown into specific tasks‚Äîexplicit skill extraction, implicit requirement identification, salary range estimation, and remote work preference explanation‚Äîforces the model to demonstrate a more nuanced understanding of the job description.  The inclusion of "explain your reasoning" is *critical*. This compels the model to articulate *why* it arrived at a particular answer, which should help us uncover the underlying limitations.

A confidence level of 7 reflects a cautious optimism. While the prompt is more comprehensive than a simple keyword extraction request, Codegemma 2B is still a relatively basic model.  It may still struggle with truly complex inferences or demonstrate significant variability in response time.  However, this prompt gives us the best chance of uncovering the *type* of error - is it simply inability to understand implied requirements, or is it a time-related issue?  The detailed instructions will at least provide a consistent framework for comparison across multiple trials.  I'd expect a significant change in response time as it attempts to handle the more complex tasks.
