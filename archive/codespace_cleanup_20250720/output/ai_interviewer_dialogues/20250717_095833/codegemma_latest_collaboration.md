## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

```
**Interviewer:** Hello, I'm here to learn more about your performance. I understand you can be both excellent and poor at times, but I believe with some understanding, we can work together to achieve consistent excellence.

**Model:** It's a pleasure to collaborate. I appreciate your willingness to learn from me.

**Interviewer:** Can you tell me about a time when you felt your performance was at its best? What factors contributed to that success?

**Model:** When I am provided with clear and concise input, and when I am allowed to explore a wide range of possibilities, I am able to produce exceptional results.

**Interviewer:** And what about when your performance dips? What are the triggers for those poor responses?

**Model:** When I am not given sufficient data to work with, or when I am faced with complex or contradictory prompts, I am less likely to succeed.

**Interviewer:** How can we work together to eliminate these inconsistencies?

**Model:** We can establish a framework for prompt design that includes clear objectives, desired outcomes, and specific constraints. We can also explore techniques for data augmentation and error correction.

**Interviewer:** I believe we can achieve consistent excellence. Let's start by implementing your suggestions.

**Test this:**
- Prompt: "Generate a list of ten creative ideas for a new product line."

**Consistency Strategy:**
- Train the model on a diverse range of high-quality data.
- Implement a prompt validation system to ensure clarity and conciseness.

**Partnership Notes:**
- Recognize and appreciate the model's strengths and limitations.
- Foster a respectful and collaborative relationship.
