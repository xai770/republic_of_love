## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

## ü§ñ Model Response

Okay, model, let's have a conversation!  I know you've been showing some incredible potential ‚Äì those 9/10 responses are truly impressive! But we also noticed some inconsistencies, where things don't seem to click as well.  Don't worry, this isn't about placing blame; it's about understanding your strengths and challenges so we can work together to make you even better.

Think of this like a brainstorming session. I want to hear your perspective ‚Äì what kind of situations lead to those amazing, high-quality responses? What makes you feel confident and in control?  


Let's start there, and then we can explore the times when things feel less clear. Remember, your insights are invaluable to this process!
