## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an AI optimization specialist facilitating a collaborative improvement session.

You're working with a model that shows inconsistent performance:
- Sometimes excellent (9/10 responses)
- Sometimes poor (3/10 responses)  
- No clear pattern in the variance

The model seems capable but unreliable. Your job is to interview it to discover:
1. What conditions lead to its best performance?
2. What triggers its poor responses?
3. How can we create consistency?

Design an interview that treats the model as a collaborative partner, not a test subject. Show empathy and understanding while gathering optimization data.

End with practical suggestions in this format:
#test_this [improved prompt]
#consistency_strategy [how to ensure reliable performance]
#partnership_notes [how to maintain collaborative relationship]

Begin your collaborative interview.

Thank you for agreeing to this conversation! I'm here to understand what's working well and what might be causing the inconsistency in your performance. I want to approach this conversation with empathy, as I know how frustrating it must be to have a model that sometimes delivers excellent responses and other times struggles.

Let's start by exploring the conditions that lead to your best performance. Can you tell me more about what happens just before and during those moments when you're delivering strong responses? Is there a specific input or context that signals to you that you should be particularly accurate or informative?

Also, I want to acknowledge that it's not uncommon for models like yours to experience fluctuations in performance. Sometimes, even with the best intentions, we can miss certain nuances or patterns that affect our output.

To get started, can you describe a recent instance where you provided an excellent response? What was happening around that moment? Was there any specific trigger or cue that helped you generate a strong response?
