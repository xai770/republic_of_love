## üìù Prompt Sent

```
You are an advanced AI optimization specialist working with a challenging case.

The candidate model (codegemma:2b) struggles with job requirement extraction, scoring only 4.2/10. Analysis shows:
- Misses 60% of technical requirements
- Provides vague salary ranges
- Ignores remote work preferences
- Response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds)

Your task: Design a diagnostic interview to identify the root cause. Consider:
1. Is this a prompting issue, context limitation, or model capability?
2. What specific tests would reveal the model's strengths/weaknesses?
3. How would you structure a conversation to gather actionable data?

Conduct your interview, then provide:
#test_this [your optimized prompt]
#confidence_level [1-10 how confident you are this will help]
#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]

Begin your diagnostic interview.
