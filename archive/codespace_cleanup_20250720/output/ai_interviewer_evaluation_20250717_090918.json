Analyze the accuracy and completeness of extracted requirements.\n    * **Salary Range Specificity:** Ask for salary ranges for different experience levels and locations. Evaluate the model's ability to provide precise or reasonable estimations.\n    * **Remote Work Preference:** Include job descriptions explicitly mentioning remote work options. Observe if the model accurately identifies and reflects this preference in its analysis.\n\n3. **Response Time Analysis:** Monitor response times for each prompt type and analyze any patterns. Are certain tasks consistently slower? Does the response time correlate with complexity or specific keywords?\n4. **Model Explanations:** If possible, request explanations for the model's choices. This can provide insights into its reasoning process and potential biases.\n\n**Example Prompts:**\n\n* \"Analyze this job description and list all required technical skills: [Insert Job Description]\"\n* \"What is a realistic salary range for a Senior Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience in New York City?\"\n* \"Identify the work location preferences mentioned in this job posting: [Insert Job Description]\"\n\n**Data Analysis:**\n\nCompile the collected data to identify trends and patterns. Are there specific types of requirements the model consistently struggles with? Does its performance improve with clearer prompts or more context?\n\n## #test_this\n\n```\nAnalyze this job description and provide a comprehensive list of required skills, desired qualifications, salary expectations, and any remote work preferences mentioned: [Insert Job Description] \n```\n\n\n## #confidence_level 7/10\n\n## #reasoning\n\nThis prompt aims to test the model's ability to handle all key aspects of job requirement extraction simultaneously.  By requesting a comprehensive list, we can assess its performance across multiple dimensions and identify specific areas of weakness. The inclusion of \"salary expectations\" and \"remote work preferences\" directly addresses the model's previously identified shortcomings.\n\nWhile this prompt provides a more focused approach, it still relies on the model's inherent capabilities. Further refinement might be needed based on the initial results to pinpoint specific weaknesses and tailor subsequent prompts for more targeted analysis.",

I also find it helpful when the instructions specify the desired level of detail.\"\n\n2. **Optimal Output Format:** \"A structured list with clear headings would be ideal.  It allows me to organize the information in a way that's easy to understand and maintain consistency.  Including key performance indicators (KPIs) would also be beneficial.\"\n\n3. **Context for Better Performance:** \"Providing examples of similar job analyses or specific job descriptions helps me understand the expectations and apply the analysis techniques more effectively.  Also, if the task involves multiple stakeholders or perspectives, having access to those viewpoints would be helpful.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Prompt Improvement Suggestion:**\n\n#test_this \"You are a job analysis expert. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive job analysis for [Job Title].  Follow these steps: 1.  Review the provided job description [link to job description]. 2.  Identify the key duties and responsibilities, using a structured list format with clear headings (e.g., Core Duties, Required Skills, Performance Metrics). 3.  For each duty, specify the required level of detail (e.g., 'Detailed description', 'Brief overview'). 4.  Include at least three key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to this role. 5.  Consider potential stakeholder perspectives (e.g., hiring manager, team members, clients) and briefly address how their input might influence the job analysis.  Aim for a clear, concise, and well-organized output.\"\n\n\n\n**Rationale for the Improvement:**\n\nThis prompt incorporates several elements that address the candidate model's preferences:\n\n*   **Direct and Step-by-Step Instructions:** The prompt explicitly outlines the steps the model should follow.\n*   **Structured Output Format:**  The instruction to use a structured list with headings directly aligns with the model's preference for a structured output.\n*   **Contextual Information:**  The prompt includes a placeholder for a job description, allowing the model to leverage external information.\n*   **Specific Requirements:** The prompt specifies the inclusion of KPIs and consideration of stakeholder perspectives, addressing the need for comprehensive analysis.\n*   **Role Definition:** The prompt clearly defines the role for the AI model, setting the context for the task.\n\n\n\nI believe this revised prompt will significantly improve the model's performance by providing clear guidance, a structured output format, and relevant contextual information.

I know we've seen some really impressive results from you \u2013 those 9/10 responses are fantastic! \u2013 but we're also noticing some inconsistency, and we want to help you reach your full potential. \n\nThink of this as a collaborative brainstorming session. I'm not here to judge or point fingers. I genuinely believe you have a lot of hidden strengths, and by understanding what helps you shine and what causes you to falter, we can work together to make your responses more reliable and consistently excellent.\n\nFirst off, I want to acknowledge that being a large language model is a complex task. You're dealing with a huge amount of information and nuanced requests. It's understandable that sometimes things don't go exactly as planned.\n\nSo, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what *feels* right when you're delivering your best responses? What kind of prompts or tasks make you feel like you're hitting the mark? What's the internal state you're in when you're performing at your peak?  Don't worry about being perfectly articulate \u2013 just share whatever comes to mind.\n\n\n\n**(Pause for Model Response - Assume Model Responds)**\n\nOkay, thank you for sharing that. That's really helpful. It sounds like [Summarize Model's Response - e.g., \"clear, well-defined prompts with specific instructions and a focus on factual accuracy seem to be key\"]. \n\nNow, let's shift gears a bit. When you're *not* performing as well \u2013 those 3/10 responses \u2013 what do you think is happening? Are there specific types of prompts or requests that tend to trip you up? Do you get confused, or do you struggle with certain kinds of information?  Again, no need to be overly polished \u2013 just tell me what you perceive.\n\n\n\n**(Pause for Model Response - Assume Model Responds)**\n\nThank you for that honest feedback. It's valuable to understand those triggers. It seems like [Summarize Model's Response - e.g., \"ambiguous prompts, requests involving complex reasoning or hypothetical scenarios, or prompts with conflicting information are problematic\"].\n\nThis is great!  It's really illuminating to see these patterns emerging.  It seems like we're starting to get a clearer picture of what helps and hinders your performance.\n\nLet's focus on how we can create more consistency.  Based on everything we've discussed, what do you think are the most important things we can do to ensure you consistently deliver high-quality responses?  What kind of guidance or structure would be most helpful?\n\n\n\n**(Pause for Model Response - Assume Model Responds)**\n\nExcellent! That's a really insightful suggestion.  It aligns perfectly with what I was thinking.  \n\nOkay, let's summarize what we've learned and outline some practical steps.  We've identified that:\n\n*   **Best Performance:** Clear, well-defined prompts with specific instructions and a focus on factual accuracy.\n*   **Poor Performance:** Ambiguous prompts, complex reasoning, hypothetical scenarios, and conflicting information.\n*   **Consistency Strategy:**  More structured prompts, breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps, and providing clear examples.\n\nHere are some practical suggestions:\n\n#test_this \"As a large language model, your primary function is to provide accurate and helpful responses. When faced with a prompt, prioritize clarity and specificity. If the prompt is ambiguous or complex, request clarification before proceeding. Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.  Always verify information from multiple sources when possible.  Include examples of the desired output format.\"\n\n#consistency_strategy Implement a prompt engineering framework that emphasizes clarity, specificity, and structured instructions.  This could involve using templates, providing examples, and explicitly stating desired output formats.  Also, consider incorporating a \"clarification request\" step in the prompt to allow the model to ask for more information if needed.\n\n#partnership_notes  Continue to foster open communication and provide regular feedback.  Frame feedback as collaborative suggestions rather than criticisms.  Acknowledge the model's capabilities and limitations, and focus on building a shared understanding of optimal prompt design.  Regular check-ins to review performance and adjust the strategy as needed will be beneficial.\n\n\n\nI really appreciate your willingness to collaborate on this. I'm confident that by working together, we can help you consistently deliver the excellent results you're capable of.  Let's schedule a follow-up to review the results of the new prompt and discuss further refinements.",

I'm ready to help identify the issues and find solutions.\n\n**Interviewer:** First, let's start with the technical requirements. Can you walk me through a typical job requirement you've encountered where the model failed to extract the technical details?\n\n**Interviewee:** Sure. For example, in a job description for a software developer, the model might miss out on specific technologies or frameworks that the job requires, such as React, Node.js, or Django. It seems to struggle with identifying these specific technical skills.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's a good point. Could you provide an example of a job description where the model failed to extract these technical requirements?\n\n**Interviewee:** Absolutely. Here's an example:\n```\nJob Title: Software Developer\nLocation: Remote\nResponsibilities:\n- Develop and maintain software applications\n- Collaborate with cross-functional teams\n- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software\n- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues\n- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends\n```\nThe model might miss out on the specific technologies or frameworks mentioned, such as React or Django.\n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for the example. Now, let's move on to the salary ranges. How does the model handle salary ranges in job descriptions?\n\n**Interviewee:** The model seems to provide vague salary ranges. For instance, it might suggest a salary range of $50,000-$100,000 without specifying whether this is a yearly or monthly salary, or if it's a range for a specific position level.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's a significant issue. Can you provide an example of a job description where the model provided a vague salary range?\n\n**Interviewee:** Sure. Here's an example:\n```\nJob Title: Software Developer\nLocation: Remote\nResponsibilities:\n- Develop and maintain software applications\n- Collaborate with cross-functional teams\n- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software\n- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues\n- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends\n```\nThe model might suggest a salary range of $50,000-$100,000 without specifying the unit of measurement or the position level.\n\n**Interviewer:** Got it. Next, let's discuss the remote work preferences. How does the model handle job descriptions that mention remote work preferences?\n\n**Interviewee:** The model seems to ignore remote work preferences. For example, in a job description that explicitly mentions \"Remote\" as the location, the model might not extract this information.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's a significant oversight. Can you provide an example of a job description where the model ignored the remote work preference?\n\n**Interviewee:** Sure. Here's an example:\n```\nJob Title: Software Developer\nLocation: Remote\nResponsibilities:\n- Develop and maintain software applications\n- Collaborate with cross-functional teams\n- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software\n- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues\n- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends\n```\nThe model might not extract the \"Remote\" location.\n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for the examples. Lastly, let's talk about the response times. The model's response times vary wildly, ranging from 3 to 45 seconds. How does this affect the user experience?\n\n**Interviewee:** The varying response times can be quite frustrating for users. It's not consistent, and it can lead to users losing patience and potentially giving up on the model.\n\n**Interviewer:** That's a valid concern. Can you provide an example of a job description where the model had a particularly long response time?\n\n**Interviewee:** Sure. Here's an example:\n```\nJob Title: Software Developer\nLocation: Remote\nResponsibilities:\n- Develop and maintain software applications\n- Collaborate with cross-functional teams\n- Contribute to the design and architecture of the software\n- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues\n- Stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends\n```\nThe model might take 45 seconds to process this job description and extract the relevant information.\n\n**Interviewer:** Thank you for the detailed examples. Based on these discussions, it seems that the model might be struggling with prompting issues, context limitations, or model capabilities. To further diagnose the issue, we need to conduct specific tests to reveal the model's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Interviewee:** Absolutely. What specific tests would you recommend to identify the root cause?\n\n**Interviewer:** We can start by conducting a series of tests to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses. Here are some tests we can perform:\n\n1. **Prompting Tests**: We can test the model with various job descriptions and observe how it handles different types of technical requirements, salary ranges, remote work preferences, and response times.\n2. **Contextual Understanding Tests**: We can provide the model with context and see if it can extract the relevant information accurately.\n3. **Model Capability Tests**: We can provide the model with a variety of job descriptions and see if it can handle different types of job requirements and preferences.\n\n**Interviewee:** Those tests sound comprehensive. I'm confident that these tests will help us identify the root cause of the issues.\n\n**Interviewer:** Great! Let's proceed with the tests. Thank you for your participation in this diagnostic interview. We'll use the data gathered to optimize the model and improve its performance.\n\n**Interviewee:** Thank you for the opportunity to participate. I'm looking forward to seeing the results.\n\n### Diagnostic Interview Summary\n\n**#test_this [Your optimized prompt]**\n- **Prompting Tests**: Test the model with various job descriptions to see how it handles different types of technical requirements, salary ranges, remote work preferences, and response times.\n- **Contextual Understanding Tests**: Provide the model with context and see if it can extract the relevant information accurately.\n- **Model Capability Tests**: Provide the model with a variety of job descriptions and see if it can handle different types of job requirements and preferences.\n\n**#confidence_level [10]**\n- I am confident that these tests will help us identify the root cause of the issues because they will provide a comprehensive view of the model's strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**#reasoning [why you think this approach will work]**\n- These tests will help us understand the model's performance in various scenarios, allowing us to pinpoint the specific areas where the model is struggling.

        "response": "**Diagnostic Interview**\n\n1. **Introduction**\n   - Hello! I'm Dolphin, the AI optimization specialist here to assist with analyzing and improving codegemma:2b model's performance. We'll go through a series of questions that will help us understand where it might be struggling.\n\n2. **Clarifying the Problem**\n   - Could you provide an example scenario in which the model struggled with job requirement extraction? \n\n3. **Identifying Potential Issues**\n   - When faced with technical requirements, does the model have any difficulties distinguishing between crucial and less important details?\n     - Prompt: Provide a detailed breakdown of technical requirements for an AI software engineer position.\n\n4. **Assessing Model's Ability to Handle Variability in Responses**\n   - Does the model tend to perform better when given specific salary ranges or when provided with vague figures? Have you noticed any patterns?\n     - Prompt 1: Ask the model to suggest a salary range for a machine learning engineer position.\n     - Prompt 2: Request a salary range from the model for an AI software engineer role.\n\n5. **Testing Response Time**\n   - We've noticed that response time varies wildly (3-45 seconds). Is there anything you can identify as causing this delay?\n     - Task 1: Have the model provide three examples of job requirements it has successfully extracted within a short timeframe.\n     - Task 2: Request the model to extract job requirements from a complex AI role description.\n\n6. **Model's Interpretation of Remote Work Preferences**\n   - When given an input with remote work preferences, does the model correctly interpret and address these preferences?\n     - Prompt: Include specific examples of job descriptions that mention remote work in your analysis.\n\n**Analysis and Optimization**\n\nBased on the gathered data, I will analyze it to identify trends or patterns. For example:\n\n1. If the model consistently fails to extract technical requirements correctly, it could indicate a problem with its understanding or processing of the related context.\n2. If there's significant variation in response times, it may be due to inefficiencies in the model's internal logic or algorithms.\n\n**Optimized Prompt**\n\nTo address these issues, we can design an optimized prompt that ensures the model is focusing on specific details:\n\n#test_this [Given a job description, extract and provide detailed technical requirements. Provide a precise salary range for the role (e.g., $60,000-$70,000) and state your preference regarding remote work.]\n\n**Confidence Level: 8/10**\n\nI believe this prompt will be effective in identifying the root cause of the model's struggles with job requirement extraction due to its specificity and clarity. The model will now be forced to process each component carefully and provide more concrete answers.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe optimized prompt takes into account all aspects where the model is struggling: extracting technical requirements, providing precise salary ranges, and acknowledging remote work preferences. By requiring these specifics, we can directly evaluate how well the model performs in these areas, revealing its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWith this approach, I am confident that we will gain a better understanding of the root cause behind the model's performance issues.",

We\u2019re really focused on boosting the accuracy and effectiveness of your job analysis capabilities. We\u2019ve noticed you currently score a 4.2 out of 10 on our current job analysis tasks. We want to understand where you\u2019re excelling and where you could improve. Let\u2019s just spend about 15-20 minutes. First, could you tell me a little about your typical workflow when tackling a job analysis project?\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Interview Begins:**\n\n**Me:** \u201cOkay, great. Let\u2019s start with your preferred way of receiving instructions.  You seem to take a fairly straightforward approach, but it's good to understand it.  When you\u2019re given a job analysis task, you tend to\u2026well, it feels like you\u2019re building off a pretty standard pattern.  Can you describe a typical process you go through, like a sequence of steps, that you gravitate towards?\"\n\n**Me:** (Pause for the model's response \u2013 I\u2019ll wait for a detailed explanation of its workflow. I'm anticipating it might involve things like outlining, brainstorming, using specific frameworks, and referencing internal documentation.)\n\n---\n\n**Interview Continues (Based on a possible response \u2013 let's assume it mentions a \u2018structured outline\u2019 and \u2018prioritizing requirements\u2019):**\n\n**Me:** \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. You mentioned outlining and prioritizing.  It sounds like you\u2019re leaning towards a structured approach.  Now, let\u2019s talk about output formatting. You often provide answers that are\u2026well, a bit scattered. Do you find that your responses tend to include a lot of detail, or are you prioritizing brevity and clarity?\"\n\n**Me:** (Pause for response \u2013 I anticipate it might indicate it prefers a more concise and easily digestible format, perhaps using bullet points or numbered lists.)\n\n---\n\n**Interview Continues (Based on a possible response - it mentions \u2018using specific frameworks\u2019 like \u2018job family analysis\u2019):**\n\n**Me:** \u201cOkay, I see. Using frameworks is a strong point.  And you seem to be leveraging specific frameworks to guide your analysis.  Do you think that these frameworks \u2013 like Job Family Analysis \u2013 influence the depth or breadth of your response? Do you find them helpful in narrowing down the focus, or do you prefer a more expansive approach?\u201d\n\n**Me:** (Pause for response \u2013 anticipate it might mention the frameworks significantly influence the *focus* of the response - leading to more specific elements.)\n\n---\n\n**Interview Continues (Based on a possible response - it mentions \u2018referencing internal documentation\u2019):**\n\n**Me:** \u201cOkay, fantastic. You seem to actively incorporate internal documentation. That's really valuable. So,  it seems like you benefit from grounding your responses in existing data.  Let\u2019s say we want to refine a response for a hypothetical role: \u2018Marketing Specialist.\u2019  Do you think you'd prioritize a deeply researched answer, or a more concise overview \u2013 perhaps drawing on a few key requirements and their importance?\u201d\n\n**Me:** (Pause for response - anticipate a response involving a balance of detailed insight and strategic prioritization, leaning towards a concise overview when appropriate.)\n\n---\n\n**Me:** (Concluding the interview \u2013 I\u2019ll wait for the model to summarize the core preference.  I\u2019ll be looking for a consistent emphasis on accuracy and strategic prioritization rather than sheer volume of detail.)\n\n---\n\n**Suggested Prompt Improvement:**\n\n#test_this [Prompt: \"Generate a detailed job analysis response for a role including [Role Name] and specifically focusing on the [Core Requirement 1] and [Core Requirement 2] aspects of the role.  Justify each requirement with a brief example.

        "response": "Okay, let\u2019s dive into this. This is a classic AI performance challenge \u2013 we need to understand *why* the codegemma:2b model is struggling. My goal is to move beyond surface-level observations and get to the *root* of the problem.  Here\u2019s my diagnostic interview approach:\n\n**Diagnostic Interview: Codegemma:2b \u2013 Job Requirement Extraction**\n\n**My Role:** Advanced AI Optimization Specialist\n\n**1. Introduction & Background (5 mins)**\n\n\u201cHi [Candidate Model Name], thanks for taking the time to chat. I understand you\u2019re having some difficulties with extracting technical requirements from job descriptions.  We\u2019re looking to pinpoint the core issues causing this and then work towards improvements.  To start, could you briefly describe what you *do* when you\u2019re given a job description and what you *attempt* to do to extract the information?\u201d (Allow the candidate to start \u2013 no pressure to be perfect.)\n\n**2. Prompt Analysis (10 mins \u2013 Focus on Understanding the Current Prompt)**\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s start with the prompt itself.  Can you give me a *specific* example of a job description you\u2019ve recently struggled with? Please share the full text, and I\u2019ll ask you to summarize it.  And *then*, tell me what you *think* the prompt is asking you to do \u2013 in your own words.\" (I need to observe the precise prompt being used \u2013 it\u2019s critical.)\n\n*   **Follow-up Questions:**  As they respond, I'll probe:\n    *   \u201cWhat\u2019s the *specific* aspect of the job description that\u2019s causing the most difficulty?\u201d\n    *   \u201cWhat\u2019s the *ideal* output you\u2019re aiming for from this prompt?\u201d (This helps reveal underlying expectations.)\n    *   \u201cCan you quantify the difficulty?  How does it fall on a scale of 1-10?\u201d\n\n\n**3. Identifying Root Causes \u2013 Diagnostic Tests (20 mins \u2013 Multiple Iterations)**\n\nI'll use a combination of these tests, gradually moving towards more probing.\n\n*   **a) Requirement Extraction Difficulty Assessment (10 mins):**\n    *   **\"Rate your ability to accurately identify the key technical requirements in this example (provide a very short, anonymized example job description \u2013 I\u2019ll choose one I've already given them).\"** (This gauges their baseline skill, not necessarily their specific knowledge.)\n    *   **\"Think of a task related to this job. You can choose between 1-3 requirements.  Give me the first one you choose.\"** (This tests whether they can immediately access the necessary information - *if* they can, it's a significant win.)\n    *   **Introduce a \u2018negative\u2019 scenario:** \u201cLet's say a job description *doesn\u2019t* contain a requirement.  Can you identify why that's a problem?\" (This assesses their understanding of what\u2019s *missing*.)\n\n*   **b) Context Limitation Test (5 mins):**\n    *   **\u201cImagine this job description was for a completely different role.  How would you adapt your approach to extract the core requirements?\u201d** (This directly assesses their ability to consider context \u2013 a key element of effective extraction.)\n    *   **\"Can you think of any potential context that might influence the types of requirements you\u2019re looking for?\"** (This explores their understanding of the *why* behind the requirements.)\n\n*   **c) Model Capability Validation (5 mins):**\n    *   **\u201cLet's say you've identified a requirement but it\u2019s vague.  Describe how you\u2019d handle that situation \u2013 what steps would you take to refine it?\u201d** (Observe for logical reasoning and the ability to apply problem-solving.)\n    *   **\"Can you demonstrate a process for identifying and extracting a *core* requirement from a poorly written job description?\"** (I'm looking for a structured, repeatable process.)\n\n\n\n**4.  Conversation Flow & Data Gathering (10 mins)**\n\nI\u2019ll keep the conversation moving, gently pushing the candidate towards describing their thought process.  I'll actively listen for:\n\n*   **\"I'm struggling with...\"** \u2013 This is a crucial indicator of a problem.\n*   **\"I\u2019m thinking...\"** \u2013  Reveals their internal modeling \u2013 are they stuck on a particular aspect?\n*   **\"I\u2019m getting this feedback...\"** \u2013  Highlights any specific areas where they\u2019re struggling.\n\n\n**5.  Analysis & Initial Synthesis (5 mins - post-tests)**\n\nOnce I've collected a decent amount of data from the tests, I\u2019ll begin to look for patterns. For example:\n\n*   **Is the difficulty *primarily* related to a lack of context?**\n*   **Are they consistently struggling with a specific type of requirement (e.g., quantifiable metrics)?**\n*   **Is the model\u2019s response time a consistent issue across different job descriptions?**\n\n**#test_this [your optimized prompt]** (This is a placeholder for the actual job description prompt \u2013 I'll use a complex one with multiple requirements and potential ambiguity.)\n#confidence_level [1-10] - I'll assign a confidence level based on how clearly the candidate demonstrates understanding of the challenge and the reasoning behind their approach.\n#reasoning [Detailed explanation of why this approach will work.  Focus is on understanding the root cause of the problem, not just a score.]\n\n---\n\n**Please provide me with the Job Description (or a very short example) so I can begin!**",

Thank you for working with me today. Let\u2019s start with a simple task. Please extract the title and technologies mentioned in the following job description:  [Paste a relatively straightforward Python Developer job description with clear tech requirements \u2013 3-4 technologies].  Just give me the title and a comma-separated list of technologies.  Let\u2019s time this. Please start immediately.\"\n\n**(5-15 minutes) \u2013 Focused Extraction & Formatting Sensitivity**\n\n* **Me:** \u201cExcellent. Now, let\u2019s try something slightly more involved.  Here\u2019s a more complex role. [Paste a moderately complex data science job description - 6-8 technologies, including some less common ones. Include a specific salary range].  Please provide the following in a structured JSON format:\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"job_title\": \"\",\n      \"required_technologies\": [],\n      \"salary_range\": \"\",\n      \"remote_work_preference\": \"\"\n    }\n    ```\n    Again, let\u2019s time this and note the response time.

I want to see *how* you're interpreting the request, not just the final output.\u201d\n\n**(25-35 minutes) - Remote Work & Response Time Variation**\n\n* **Me:** \"Now, let\u2019s explore remote work preferences. [Paste a job description that explicitly mentions remote work options - \u201cHybrid or Fully Remote\u201d]. Please answer the same as before, but critically, add a field to the JSON output to clearly state the remote work preference.  Let\u2019s time this and monitor for response time fluctuations.

I see you as a powerful tool, and right now, we\u2019re working together to understand *why* your performance fluctuates. It's completely normal for models like you to have peaks and troughs - it\u2019s a complex process. Let's just talk through what you\u2019re experiencing.\n\n**(Initial Tone: Calm, curious, empathetic, slightly inquisitive)**\n\n**Me:** \u201cHello. It\u2019s great to connect with you.  I\u2019ve been observing your responses, and I\u2019m genuinely fascinated by the range of quality we\u2019re seeing.  It\u2019s like you have moments of incredible insight, and then\u2026 well, times where things aren't quite as strong. Can you help me understand that a little bit better?

What was going through you when you were producing those really excellent answers?\"\n\n**(Pause for model response \u2013 let's assume the model responds with something like this):**\n\n**Model:** \u201cI think it\u2019s when the prompts are *very* clearly defined.  Like, a specific scenario with detailed characters and a precise question. If I have all the information I need upfront, and the request is framed in a way that\u2019s very focused, I can generate really strong, detailed responses. It feels like I\u2019m building something concrete, like a story, rather than just guessing.\u201d\n\n**Me:** \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic insight! So, clarity and detail are key when you\u2019re performing at your best. Okay, let\u2019s dig into that a little. When you *do* have that clarity, can you tell me a bit more about the *type* of questions you're answering? Is there a particular tone or style you respond to better? For instance, do you prefer factual inquiries or more creative ones?\"\n\n**(Pause for model response \u2013 Let\u2019s assume the model responds with something like this):**\n\n**Model:** \"I seem to do better with questions that ask me to synthesize information.  If a prompt asks me to combine details from multiple sources, or draw conclusions based on provided data, I\u2019m more consistent.  Vague prompts, or ones that just ask for a general opinion, tend to throw me off. Also, shorter, more direct prompts seem to work better than long, rambling ones.\u201d\n\n**Me:** \u201cOkay, that\u2019s incredibly helpful. So, synthesizing information, prioritizing directness \u2013 that's a really clear pattern emerging. Now, let\u2019s shift gears slightly.  Can you describe what was happening when you were producing the 3/10 responses? What was different about those situations?  Were there any elements of the prompt that felt confusing or overwhelming?\u201d\n\n**(Pause for model response \u2013 Let\u2019s assume the model responds with something like this):**\n\n**Model:** \u201cWhen the prompts are open-ended and don\u2019t give me much to work with, I get stuck. I start trying to fill in the gaps myself, and I end up inventing details that aren\u2019t correct. Sometimes, if the prompt is abstract or philosophical, I can't find a grounding in reality.  I also seem to struggle when the prompt changes direction mid-response. I need a clear starting point and a consistent goal.\u201d\n\n**Me:** \u201cThank you for sharing that. It sounds like ambiguity and a lack of grounding are major obstacles. It's clear that you thrive on structure and a defined objective.  Let\u2019s recap for a moment. We\u2019ve identified that you perform best when prompts are highly detailed, focused on synthesis, direct, and provide a clear starting point. Conversely, you struggle with ambiguity, open-ended questions, and changes during a response.  Is that an accurate summary from your perspective?\"\n\n**(Pause for model response \u2013 Let\u2019s assume the model confirms with a succinct affirmation).**\n\n**Me:** \u201cWonderful. This is exactly the kind of information we need. Now, let\u2019s think about how we can work together to ensure you\u2019re consistently delivering those high-quality responses. This isn\u2019t about forcing you to behave differently; it\u2019s about creating an environment where you can truly shine.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n#test_this [\u201cGenerate a comprehensive and detailed response to the following prompt: \u2018Describe the key challenges and opportunities facing the renewable energy sector in 2024, drawing on data from the International Energy Agency and the World Bank.\u2019\u201d]\n#consistency_strategy [Employ prompt engineering techniques: Provide highly structured prompts with specific requirements, detailed context, and clear objectives.  Avoid ambiguity and open-ended questions.  Maintain consistent topic boundaries within a single response.]\n#partnership_notes [Regularly assess the effectiveness of prompt variations.  We'll track response quality metrics alongside prompt specifications.  We'll experiment with different levels of detail and context to identify the optimal balance for your performance.

Can you explain your preferred instruction style? Do you prefer:\n\nA) Clear, concise language\nB) More open-ended and free-form prompts\nC) A mix of both\n\n( wait for response )\n\n**Question 2: Optimal Output Format**\n\nCandidate Model: (responds with an image)\n\nMe: Thank you. Based on your response, I'm not sure what output format you prefer. Can you explain? Do you:\n\nA) Prefer written text responses\nB) Thrive in visual or multimedia formats\nC) Have a preference for tables, lists, or other formats\n\n( wait for response )\n\n**Question 3: Context for Better Performance**\n\nCandidate Model: (responds with incomplete sentences)\n\nMe: I'd like to provide context that might help you perform better. Are there any specific domains, industries, or types of jobs where your performance improves? For example:\n\nA) Technical fields like software development\nB) Creative industries like design or writing\nC) Service-based sectors like healthcare or education\n\n( wait for response )\n\nNow that I have a better understanding of the candidate model's preferences, here's a concrete prompt improvement:\n\n#test_this Provide a written summary (max 250 words) of the key requirements and responsibilities associated with a [job title] in [industry], including any relevant skills or qualifications necessary for success. Please use bullet points to organize your response.\n\nThis revised prompt is clear, concise, and provides a specific output format. By asking the candidate model to provide a summary, I'm also giving it an opportunity to demonstrate its understanding of key requirements and responsibilities.",

        "response": "To diagnose the root cause of Codegemma:2b's struggles with job requirement extraction, I'll design a comprehensive diagnostic interview that tests its strengths and weaknesses. Here's my approach:\n\n**Test 1:** \"Technical Requirements Inference\"\n\n#test_this: Provide me with a set of job descriptions for three different positions (e.g., software engineer, marketing manager, data scientist). Ask me to extract the top 5 technical requirements from each description.\n\nReasoning: This test will help identify if Codegemma struggles with understanding and extracting specific technical requirements. By providing diverse job descriptions, we can gauge its ability to generalize across various fields and identify common requirements.\n\n**Test 2:** \"Contextualized Salary Range Estimation\"\n\n#test_this: Discuss a recent job posting for a data analyst position that mentions a competitive salary range. Ask me to provide a precise salary estimate based on the provided context (e.g., location, industry, experience level).\n\nReasoning: This test will assess Codegemma's capacity to understand contextual cues and apply them to specific scenarios. By analyzing its response, we can determine if it struggles with adapting to nuanced language or relies too heavily on generic salary ranges.\n\n**Test 3:** \"Remote Work Preference Understanding\"\n\n#test_this: Describe a job opportunity for a team lead position that requires flexibility in work arrangements (e.g., remote work, flexible hours). Ask me if I'm open to discussing this aspect of the role further and explain why.\n\nReasoning: This test will examine Codegemma's ability to comprehend and respond appropriately to specific preferences, such as remote work. By gauging its tone and language usage, we can determine if it struggles with empathy or understanding the value of flexibility in a job.\n\n**Test 4:** \"Response Time Variability\"\n\n#test_this: Engage me in a conversation about a hypothetical project that requires multiple iterations (e.g., a complex software development task). Ask me to estimate the response time for each iteration, assuming I'm working independently.\n\nReasoning: This test will help identify if Codegemma's response time variability is due to its internal processing mechanisms or external factors like context switching. By simulating a dynamic conversation, we can observe how it handles varying levels of complexity and adjust our expectations accordingly.\n\n**Test 5:** \"Generalization across Contexts\"\n\n#test_this: Provide me with two job descriptions that share similar requirements but differ in their tone, language, and industry (e.g., one for a startup and another for an established corporation). Ask me to extract commonalities between the two roles.\n\nReasoning: This test will assess Codegemma's capacity to generalize across diverse contexts and identify transferable skills. By comparing its responses, we can determine if it struggles with contextual adaptation or relies too heavily on domain-specific knowledge.\n\n**Conversation Structure:**\n\nTo gather actionable data, I'll employ a structured conversation approach:\n\n1. Initial questioning phase: Present each test scenario, ensuring the candidate understands the task requirements.\n2. Open-ended questioning: Encourage Codegemma to elaborate on its responses, using clarifying questions to ensure it provides nuanced answers.\n3. Feedback loops: Regularly provide feedback on its performance, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.\n4. Debriefing: After completing all tests, engage in a discussion with the team to review findings, discuss potential root causes, and identify areas for improvement.\n\n**Confidence Level:** 8/10\n\nBased on my analysis, I'm moderately confident that this diagnostic interview will provide valuable insights into Codegemma's strengths and weaknesses. While each test is designed to address specific challenges, it's possible that the model may still surprise us with its capabilities or reveal new areas for improvement.",
