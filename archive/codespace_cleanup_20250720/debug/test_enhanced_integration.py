Integration Test - Enhanced Specialists New Pipeline
===================================================

Test script to validate that the enhanced specialists are working in the
new enhanced pipeline runner without modifying Sandy's original code.
This follows the Golden Rules: no changes to Sandy, only new versions.

Run this to verify the enhanced specialists are working correctly.
