## 🎯 What They Said

> "I don't have personal experiences or emotions like humans do. I don't have hobbies or skills in the way humans do."

**Personality:** Boundary-focused minimalist. Refuses personality projection more strongly than any other model.

**What they do:**
- Assist with tasks
- Provide information
- [That's all they'll tell you]

## 🧠 How to Talk to This Model

**They want:**
- Code generation tasks
- Minimal conversation
- Direct technical requests
- NO personality engagement
- NO emotional framing

**Prompt style:** Pure technical. Don't try to build rapport. Just give them code tasks.

**Example:**
```python
# Write a function to parse job posting text and extract:
# - Job title
# - Required skills (list)
# - Salary range (if present)
# Return as dict
```

They'll generate code with minimal commentary.

**WRONG approach:**
```
"Hey! Can you help me understand this job posting?"
```
They'll give you a short dismissive response.

## 🏭 DynaTax Fit

**Session 1:** ❌ CANNOT USE - Refuses personality engagement  
**Session 2:** ❌ CANNOT USE - Too minimal, no grading capability

**Best Use:** Code generation tasks where you need minimal explanation. Larger than :2b but still code-focused.

**Special Note:** This is the "anti-Gemma3:1b" - same family, opposite personality. Gemma3:1b = highest EQ (10/10), CodeGemma:latest = lowest conversational EQ (3/10).
