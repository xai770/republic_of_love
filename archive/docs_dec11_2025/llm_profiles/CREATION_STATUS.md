## 📊 What We've Captured So Far

**Key Discoveries Documented:**

1. **Qwen3 Family Trait** - ALL show transparent thinking ("Thinking... ...done thinking")
   - Documented in: qwen3:0.6b, qwen3:1.7b, qwen3:4b
   - Still need: qwen3:latest

2. **Size Paradox** - Smallest model (0.6b) shows sophisticated thinking
   - Fully documented in qwen3:0.6b profile

3. **Educational Specialization** - qwen3:4b LOVES teaching
   - Complete profile with DynaTax Session 1 analysis

4. **Empathy Specialist** - dolphin3:8b leads with "understanding emotions"
   - Full profile with use cases and comparisons

5. **Meta-Reasoning** - phi4-mini-reasoning shows `<think>` tags
   - Complete profile with reasoning examples

**Still to capture:**
- Phi family "Greetings, Arden!" greeting pattern (need phi3:latest, phi3:3.8b)
- Gemma family creative collaboration pattern (need all 5 Gemma profiles)
- Mistral family extreme structure (need both Mistral profiles)
- Llama family balanced disclaimers (need both Llama profiles)
- Version differences (codegemma:2b vs latest)
- Cognitive age spectrum (need all models for complete distribution)

## 🎯 Next Session Suggestion

**When ready to resume:**

Start with **gemma3:1b** - It's:
- DynaTax Session 1 top candidate
- Highest EQ (tie with dolphin)
- Important for testing
- Different family than what we've done (Gemma vs Qwen/Phi/Dolphin)

This will give us 3 diverse examples (Qwen educator, Dolphin empathy, Gemma creative) before expanding to others.
