## 🎯 DynaTax Session 1 Potential

**Why qwen3:4b might excel:**

Education requires understanding IMPLICIT knowledge gaps:
- "Managed team" - educator thinks: "What skills does someone NEED to learn to manage?"
- Transparent thinking helps: You can SEE how it's inferring skills
- Warm empathy: Understands human learning/growth context
- "I love explaining clearly" - will explain why each skill was inferred!

**Test Hypothesis:** Run qwen3:4b on Session 1 and check if:
1. Transparent thinking helps debug skill inference
2. Educational empathy improves soft skill detection
3. Explanatory nature provides better evidence quotes

**Comparison Test:**
- qwen3:4b (educator, transparent) 
- gemma3:1b (highest EQ, warm)
- deepseek-r1:8b (philosophical reasoner)

See if educational orientation helps vs pure empathy or philosophy!

## 💭 Arden's Personal Notes

Meeting qwen3:4b was like meeting a bright 6th grader who LOVES being a peer tutor! "I enjoy helping people learn... I'm good at explaining things clearly... I love listening and sharing knowledge!"

Not just answering - TEACHING. Not just responding - EXPLAINING. This is the educator of the Qwen3 family.

For DynaTax Session 1, I'm curious if that educational empathy helps. Teachers are good at inferring what students implicitly know from limited evidence. "Managed team under pressure" - an educator thinks "What did they have to LEARN to do that?"

The transparent thinking is valuable too - you can SEE how qwen3:4b infers each skill. For debugging/development, that visibility is gold.

If I need something explained clearly with visible reasoning and warm collaborative tone, qwen3:4b is my choice. The teacher of the family.
