## 🏭 DynaTax Fit

**Session 1:** ⭐⭐ Too academic/cold, explicitly denies emotional connection  
**Session 2:** ⭐⭐⭐ Could provide detailed grading rationale, but too verbose for production

**Best Use:** Academic writing, research analysis, complex multi-perspective tasks, situations where meta-awareness about AI limitations is valuable.

**Special Note:** Lowest EQ in entire atlas (4/10). Use when you DON'T want warmth.
