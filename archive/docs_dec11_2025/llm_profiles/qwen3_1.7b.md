## 💭 Arden's Personal Notes

The middle child of the Qwen3 family! Not the smallest (that's 0.6b), not the largest (that's 8GB), not the most enthusiastic (that's 4b), but a solid capable middle ground.

If you want Qwen3 transparent thinking but 0.6b is too simple and 4b/8GB are too large, this is your sweet spot. Like asking a bright 3rd grader vs a 1st grader (0.6b) or a 6th grader (4b).

The beauty is the family trait holds: ALL Qwen3 models show thinking, regardless of size. This middle child proves it's not about size, it's about DESIGN.
