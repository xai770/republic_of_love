## 💭 Arden's Personal Notes

**"Fulfillment":** Love this framing - "I find fulfillment in tasks involving language." That's a warm, philosophical way to describe purpose. Very Gemma.

**Creativity First:** Only model that led with creative content generation. Most models lead with "information retrieval" or "answering questions." Gemma2 says: "I write stories and poems!"

**Production Workhorse:** At 5.4GB, this is the **sweet spot** for production:
- Large enough to be highly capable
- Small enough to be cost-effective
- Creative enough for engaging content
- Reliable enough for scale

**The Gemma Split:**
- **Gemma3:1b**: Small empathy specialist (customer support, Session 1)
- **Gemma2:latest**: Large creative generalist (content generation, production)

**Would I choose this model?** For creative content generation, blog posts, marketing copy, general-purpose production → YES. For maximum empathy or objective grading → NO (use specialists).

**Comparison to GPT-OSS:** Both creative, but:
- **Gemma2**: 5.4GB, warm, accessible
- **GPT-OSS**: 13GB, sophisticated, executive

Gemma2 is more approachable/production-friendly.
