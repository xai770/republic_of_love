Starting with the position overview: The Audit Manager will coordinate central responses to security monitoring topics. They'll improve audit practices that ensure integrity.

Okay, let's tackle this job requirement extraction. The user wants me to categorize the technical and business requirements from the Deutsche Bank Audit Manager position into two exact sections. Each bullet point needs a specific skill or knowledge area marked as Critical/Important/Nice-to-have.

First, I need to read through the Job Description thoroughly. Let me start by skimming for technical skills, programming languages, tools, etc., under TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. Then look for business processes, domain knowledge like finance, audit procedures, industry expertise in regulatory developments, etc., under BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS.

Looking at the Position Overview: The role is an Audit Specialist in Endpoint Security Team under CSO. Responsibilities include coordinating responses to security monitoring themes, improving audit practice improvements, contributing to integrity, focusing on coordination and solutions based on audit results. There's mention of working with engineers, architects, ensuring compliance with regulations and standards. So technical requirements might involve tools for cybersecurity, endpoint management, perhaps programming languages if they deal with scripts or automation? Wait, the job mentions coordinating audits, so maybe familiarity with security software, monitoring tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), intrusion detection systems? Also, since it's about endpoint security, knowledge of antivirus programs, firewall configurations?

Under Business Requirements: The role requires understanding audit processes, regulatory requirements in finance. Domain knowledge would be accounting/finance regulations, internal revision controls. Industry expertise here is definitely the financial services sector, compliance standards like SOX, GDPR (if applicable), maybe PCI DSS if handling payment data. Also, collaboration with engineering and architecture teams implies teamwork skills but that's more soft skill.

In the job overview and responsibilities, there's a need for coordination across teams, which implies communication skills.

Also, problem-solving is mentioned as they handle security monitoring themes and improve audit practices. The proactive approach in coordinating responses suggests analytical thinking.

EDUCATION REQUIRED: Bachelor's or higher, preferably relevant degrees and certifications. Language needs‚ÄîGerman probably since it's Deutsche Bank, but English is also mentioned as needed for job functions like coordination within a global team where they interact with engineering teams in possibly different locations.

Wait, the user wants specific format sections. Let me check if I missed anything else. The job description says "√úber den Bereich Chief Security Office (CSO)" which might relate to security expertise but that's more experience than soft skill?

Looking at the "Ihre Aufgaben" section, which translates to "Your Tasks", I need to list the responsibilities. The tasks include proactive coordination of the Endpoint Security Team, end-to-end deployment support, validation of audit and regulatory services, setting team participation and responsibilities, reviewing customer action plans, documenting workflows and checklists, supporting audit plans, and fostering a team environment with leadership and development.

Next, the "Ihre F√§higkeiten und Erfahrungen" section is about the profile. The requirements include a bachelor's degree, preferably with advanced degrees or certifications. They need extensive knowledge of risks, controls, regulatory developments, audit experience in internal audit or financial services, management and planning skills, and fluency in German and English.

Wait, there's also a section about what the bank offers, which is probably not needed here. The user only wants "Your Tasks" and "Your Profile". I should make sure not to include the benefits part. 

I should structure "Your Tasks" with bullet points, each task clearly separated. For "Your Profile", list the qualifications and skills required. Need to check for any other sections that might have relevant info. The position overview also mentions the role's focus on coordination, solutions for audit results, collaboration with teams, and implementing industry standards. These might be part of the tasks. 

Also, the part about suppor...

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract soft skills, experience requirements, and education requirements from the given job description. They provided a specific format, so I need to make sure I follow that exactly.

First, I'll read through the job description carefully to identify the relevant sections. The job is for an Audit Manager at Deutsche Bank. The position overview and responsibilities are key here. 

Starting with soft skills. The job mentions "proaktive Koordination" which translates to proactive coordination, so that's a soft skill. Then there's "Unterst√ºtzung bei Festlegung der Teambeteiligung und individuellen Verantwortlichkeiten" which implies teamwork and responsibility. Also, the part about "Kommunikation der Auditpl√§ne und Werte der Bank" points to communication skills. The mention of "Emotional ausgeglichen" and "positive Haltung" might relate to emotional intelligence, but the user's example format includes communication, leadership, and problem-solving. So maybe I should focus on those aspects. Also, "F√§higkeit, Ver√§nderungen positiv voranzutreiben" suggests adaptability or initiative, which could fall under problem-solving or leadership.

Next, experience requirements. The job says "Umfassende Auditerfahrung innerhalb der internen Revision und/oder der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche" so that's experience in internal audit or financial services. There's also a mention of "Management und Planung" which could relate to seniority. The role is part of the CSO, which is a senior position, so seniority is required. The job also mentions "globale Rolle" implying that experience in a global context is needed, but maybe that's more about experience in a specific domain.

For education, the job states "Bachelor- oder gleichwertiger Abschluss erforderlich" so a bachelor's degree is required. It also mentions "weiteref√ºhrende Abschl√ºsse und einschl√§gige berufliche Zertifizierungen bevorzugt" so advanced degrees or certifications...

Okay, the user wants the requirements for the Audit Manager position at Deutsche Bank, specifically in Frankfurt. They don't need info about the company or what the role entails, just what they need to bring to the table. Also, they need the German text translated into English.

First, I'll go through the original German text and extract the key requirements. Let me start by reading through the job description again. The position is for an Audit Specialist in the Endpoint Security Team under the CSO. The responsibilities include coordinating responses to security monitoring issues, improving audit practices, and ensuring compliance with regulations. The user wants the requirements, so I need to focus on the qualifications and skills mentioned.

Looking at the "Ihre F√§higkeiten und Erfahrungen" section, there are specific points: Bachelor's degree required, advanced degrees and certifications preferred. Then, extensive knowledge of risks, controls, regulatory developments. Comprehensive audit experience in internal audit or financial services. Strong management and planning skills, ability to drive positive change. Excellent German and English language skills.

I need to make sure I don't include any of the company benefits or the role overview. The user only wants the requirements. Also, the translation needs to be accurate. Let me check each part again to ensure I didn't miss any key points. The user also mentioned translating the German text into English, so I should provide both the extracted requirements and the translated version. 

Wait, the user said "Only the stuff I need to bring to the table" so I need to structure the requirements clearly, maybe bullet points. Also, the translation should be a direct translation of the German text provided. Let me verify that the translation is correct. For example, "Auditpl√§ne und Werte der Bank" translates to "audit plans and the bank's values."

Okay, let's tackle this job description. The user wants me to extract technical and business requirements, categorizing them into the specified sections with the right tags. 

First, I need to read through the job description carefully. The position is an Audit Manager in the Chief Security Office at Deutsche Bank, focusing on Endpoint Security. The main responsibilities involve coordinating responses to audit findings, ensuring compliance with regulations, and working with various teams.

Starting with technical requirements. The job mentions coordination with engineers, architects, and department heads. They need to create solutions that align with current regulations and the bank's standards. There's a mention of audit processes, validation, and documentation. Also, they need to support audit plans and communicate within the team. 

Looking for specific technical skills or tools. The job talks about audit processes, validation, documentation, and workflow tracking. But there's no explicit mention of programming languages or specific tools. However, since it's about audit and compliance, maybe tools related to audit management or documentation systems. But the job doesn't specify any particular ones. So maybe technical requirements are more about process management rather than specific tools. Wait, the user wants technical skills or tools. If the job doesn't mention specific ones, maybe there are none. But the job does mention "branchenf√ºhrender Standards f√ºr Prozesskontrollen und -verfahren," which translates to industry-leading standards for process controls and procedures. That's more about process than tools. So maybe there are no critical technical requirements here. But the user wants to extract them. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The job mentions "End-to-End-Bereitstellung" which might imply some technical processes, but not specific tools. So perhaps the technical requirements are minimal here.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract technical and business requirements from the job description. First, I need to focus on the two categories: Technical Requirements and Business Requirements.

Starting with Technical Requirements. The job is about an Audit Manager in the Endpoint Security Team. The key technical skills here would be related to audit processes, security tools, and maybe specific programming languages. The job mentions "Audit Specialist*in" and "Endpoint Security Team," so tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems are probably important. Also, they need to handle audit validation, which involves documentation and processes. So, maybe mention tools like Splunk or ELK stack as Critical. Programming languages like Python or Java for scripting and automation would be Nice-to-have.

Then Business Requirements. The business aspects include understanding audit processes, regulatory compliance, and industry-specific knowledge. The job requires knowledge of risk management, audit procedures, and regulatory frameworks. Also, the need to coordinate with engineering teams and ensure compliance with bank standards. The business skill here is industry expertise in finance and audit, along with domain knowledge in security and compliance. The company values a positive work culture and benefits, but those are more about the company's offerings rather than technical or business requirements.

Wait, the user specified to focus on concrete skills and knowledge areas. So, for business, things like audit processes, regulatory compliance, risk management, and industry standards. The job also mentions working with engineering teams, so collaboration and process management. The technical tools like SIEM, ELK, and maybe specific audit tools like Splunk or similar. Programming languages like Python for scripting, Java for backend, etc.

I need to make sure each requirement is marked as Critical, Important, or Nice-to-have. ...

First, I need to read through the provided job description carefully. The job is an Audit Manager position at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. The main sections are the Position Overview, Responsibilities, and the Offer. 

Starting with "Your Tasks" ‚Äì the job description mentions several specific tasks. The Audit Manager is responsible for coordinating central responses to security monitoring topics, supporting audit validations, documenting workflows, and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Then, "Your Profile" includes the required qualifications: Bachelor's degree or equivalent, relevant certifications, experience in internal audit or financial services, management and planning skills, and proficiency in German and English. The offer includes benefits like health insurance, fitness programs, and a flexible work environment. 

I need to make sure I don't miss any key points. The responsibilities section has a lot of details, so I should list them clearly. The tasks section should capture both the day-to-day duties and the team support aspects. 

Wait, the user specified "Your Tasks" and "Your Profile". Let me check again. The Position Overview has the role description, and the Responsibilities section lists the tasks. The Profile section includes the qualifications. The offer is separate but not part of the tasks or profile. 

I need to structure the answer with the two sections. Make sure the tasks are in bullet points and the profile is also in bullet points. Avoid any markdown, just plain text. Also, ensure that the tasks and profile are distinct.

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the requirements for the Audit Manager position and then translate the provided German text into English. First, I need to parse the German text carefully. The job description is quite lengthy, so I'll need to identify the key sections related to the requirements.

Starting with the job title: "Audit Manager (d/m/w)" which indicates part-time, full-time, and temporary positions. The job ID is R0380962. The location is Frankfurt. The position overview mentions the Chief Security Office (CSO) at Deutsche Bank, looking for an Audit Specialist in the Endpoint Security Team. The responsibilities include coordinating central responses to security monitoring topics, improving audit practices, and maintaining compliance with bank standards.

The user mentioned only the requirements, not the company's activities. So I need to list the qualifications and responsibilities. The required qualifications are a Bachelor's or equivalent degree, plus advanced qualifications, and extensive experience in internal audit and financial services. Skills include risk management, audit processes, regulatory developments, and excellent German and English proficiency.

The benefits section is also part of the requirements? Wait, no, the user asked for the requirements, not the benefits. The benefits are part of the job offer, not the requirements. So I should exclude that.

Now, translating the German text into English. The original text is a job description. I need to make sure the translation is accurate and captures all the key points. Terms like "Audit Specialist" should be translated appropriately. Also, the structure of the German text is a bit complex, so breaking it down into clear sections will help.

Next, supporting the assignment of team involvement and individual responsibilities for each audit validation.

I should make sure that each point is clearly separated and not mixed. Also, check if there are any other points I might have missed.

The user didn't ask for that, so maybe just focus on the tasks and qualifications. Also, the job offers benefits, but the user only wants the requirements and responsibilities.

The job overview mentions the role in the Chief Security Office (CSO) at Deutsche Bank, the responsibilities of coordinating audit responses, improving audit practices, ensuring compliance with regulations, and working with engineering and architecture teams. The responsibilities include proactive coordination, end-to-end deployment, supporting team involvement, documenting workflows, and ensuring understanding within the team. The required skills are a bachelor's degree, knowledge of risks and controls, audit experience, management and planning skills, and fluency in German and English.

I need to structure this information clearly in English, making sure to list the requirements without any extra details. Also, the user mentioned translating the German text, so I need to ensure the translation is accurate and that the requirements are properly extracted. Let me check each paragraph to confirm I'm not missing any key points. The user might be applying for this role, so the requirements should be precise and to the point. I should avoid any markdown and present it in a clear, numbered list if possible. Let me verify that all the necessary aspects are covered: education, experience, skills, language proficiency, and any other specific qualifications mentioned.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to extract soft skills, experience requirements, and education requirements from the given job description. First, I need to read through the job description carefully to identify relevant sections.

Starting with the "Soft Skills" section. The job description mentions "Sehr gute Kenntnisse im Hinblick auf Management und Planung, mit der F√§higkeit, Ver√§nderungen positiv voranzutreiben" which translates to good knowledge in management and planning, ability to drive changes positively. That's a soft skill. Then, "Sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse (in Wort und Schrift)" is language proficiency, which is a soft skill. Also, "Koordination und Bereitstellung von L√∂sungen" implies coordination and problem-solving, which are soft skills. And "Personalf√ºhrung und -entwicklung" is leadership and team development. So those would be the soft skills.

Next, experience requirements. The job says "Umfassende Auditerfahrung innerhalb der internen Revision und/oder der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche im weiteren Sinne" which is extensive audit experience in internal audit or financial services. Then, "Proaktive Koordination aller Aspekte des Endpoint Security Teams" suggests the ability to coordinate, which is a soft skill but maybe under experience. Wait, but the user wants experience requirements. The job mentions "Fachkenntnisse √ºber Risiken, Kontrollen und damit verbundene regulatorische Entwicklungen" which is knowledge of risks, controls, and regulatory developments. Also, "F√§higkeit, Ver√§nderungen positiv voranzutreiben" is part of the soft skills. Wait, maybe the experience is in audit and security, and the ability to manage projects. So the experience required would be extensive audit experience in the financial sector, and experience in managing projects or coordinating teams.

For education, the job says "Bachelor- oder gleichwertiger Abschluss erforderlich; weiterf√ºhrende Abschl√ºsse und einschl√§gige berufliche...

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract technical and business requirements from the job description. The job is for an Audit Manager in the Endpoint Security Team at Deutsche Bank. 

First, I need to focus on technical requirements. The job description mentions things like coordinating the Endpoint Security Team, which involves technical aspects. They talk about audit results, so maybe some technical tools or platforms. Also, the job requires knowledge of security protocols and compliance, which might be technical. The mention of "End-to-End-Bereitstellung" and "Validierung von Audit- und beh√∂rdlichen Leistungen" suggests some technical processes. The need for "Risiken, Kontrollen und regulatorische Entwicklungen" might relate to specific tools or technologies. Also, the job requires knowledge of "Management und Planung" which could be a technical skill. They also mention "Auditpl√§ne" which might involve specific software or platforms. But I need to check if these are specific enough.

For business requirements, the job requires "Auditerfahrung innerhalb der internen Revision und/oder der Finanzdienstleistungsbranche" which is business process knowledge. "Management und Planung" is a business skill. "Kommunikation der Auditpl√§ne und Werte der Bank" is about business processes. Also, "Personalf√ºhrung und -entwicklung" is a business skill. The mention of "regulatorische Entwicklungen" is a business requirement. The job also requires "Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse" which is a language skill, but the user said to focus on business and technical, so maybe that's a business requirement. Wait, but the instructions say to focus on business process or domain knowledge, industry expertise, etc. So maybe language skills are part of business requirements if they're needed for communication within the bank.

Wait, the user's instructions say to extract only specific, actionable requirements. So I need to make sure each point is concrete. For example, "Au...

Okay, let's see. The user wants me to extract the requirements and responsibilities from the job description, present them in two clear sections: "Your Tasks" and "Your Profile."

First, I need to read through the job description carefully. The main topic is about an Audit Manager role at Deutsche Bank. The user provided the entire job description, so I need to identify the key points.

Looking at "Your Tasks," there are several sections mentioned. The first part is about coordinating security responses and improving audit practices. Then, they mention supporting team collaboration, providing expert opinions, documenting workflows, and supporting audit plans. Also, there's the part about documentation and communication with other teams. So, I need to structure these into two clear sections.

For "Your Profile," the requirements are about a bachelor's or equivalent degree, additional higher education, relevant certifications, knowledge in risk management, audit experience, management skills, and language skills. Then, the responsibilities include team collaboration, working with engineers and architects, documentation, supporting audit plans, and communication with other teams.

Wait, the user specified two clear sections. Let me make sure I didn't miss any points. The tasks section includes coordinating, documentation, supporting, and communication. The profile includes education, certifications, required skills, and language. I need to present these in the two sections as specified, without any markdown and in plain text.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to extract technical and business requirements from the job description and categorize them as Critical, Important, or Nice-to-have. So first, I need to read through the job description carefully and identify the relevant parts.

Starting with the technical requirements. The job is for an Audit Specialist in the Endpoint Security Team at Deutsche Bank. The user mentioned extracting specific technical skills and tools, programming languages, and platforms. Looking at the job, there's mention of managing audit results and collaboration with engineering and architectural teams. But the description doesn't specify any technical tools or skills. Wait, the job says "Umfangreiche und fundierte Kenntnisse √ºber Risiken, Kontrollen..." which suggests they need expertise in risk management and process controls. Also, "Umfassende Auditerfahrung..." implies experience in audits. But again, the technical skills here are about knowledge areas, not specific tools. The user's instructions say to focus on concrete skills and knowledge areas, so maybe just list the required knowledge areas without specific tools. So for technical, maybe "Knowledge in Risk Management and Process Controls" as Important, and "Experience in Audit Processes" as Important. But the user's example shows entries like "Specific technical skill or tool" and "Programming language, technology, platform." Since there's no specific tools mentioned, maybe those are not present. So maybe technical requirements here are the required knowledge areas. 

For business requirements, the job emphasizes collaboration with teams, documentation, audit planning, and communication. The user's instructions say to categorize into Business process or domain knowledge. So business requirements here would be things like process documentation, audit planning, communication, collaboration. The job mentions "Dokumentation von Workflows, Fortschrittsverfolgung..." which is part of documen...
