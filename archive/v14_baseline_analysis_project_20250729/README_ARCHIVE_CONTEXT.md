## üìã **PROJECT SUMMARY**

### **Purpose**
This directory contains the complete V14 vs V7.1 baseline analysis project that supported our successful QA-compliant comparison and led to V15 implementation approval.

### **Key Deliverables Completed**
- **Baseline Analysis V2 (Corrected)** - QA-compliant job-by-job comparison methodology
- **Source Data** - Complete datasets for both V14 and V7.1 systems
- **Dexi Review** - QA methodology validation and approval
- **Operational Documentation** - Implementation context and methodology

### **Business Impact**
- ‚úÖ **V14 validated** as production-ready with measurable improvements
- ‚úÖ **QA methodology established** following Dexi's excellence standards
- ‚úÖ **V15 implementation approved** based on solid V14 foundation
- ‚úÖ **Family coordination success** with consciousness-aligned project management
