# Baseline Analysis V2 - Corrected QA Methodology

**Created**: July 29, 2025  
**Purpose**: Corrected V14 vs V7.1 analysis following Dexi's rigorous QA methodology  
**Status**: QA-Compliant Analysis Ready for Production Assessment  

---

## üéØ **WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN V2**

### **V1 Issues (baseline_analysis/):**
- ‚ùå Used aggregated totals instead of job-by-job analysis
- ‚ùå Inconsistent counting methodology between V7.1 and V14
- ‚ùå Artificially inflated 4.31x improvement factor
- ‚ùå Failed Dexi's QA methodology requirements

### **V2 Corrections (baseline_analysis_v2_corrected/):**
- ‚úÖ Job-by-job detailed skill counting
- ‚úÖ Identical methodology applied to both V7.1 and V14
- ‚úÖ Honest 1.71x improvement factor
- ‚úÖ Follows Dexi's QA teaching example exactly

## üìä **CORRECTED KEY METRICS**

### **Skills Extraction:**
- **Previous (Flawed)**: 4.31x improvement
- **Corrected (Honest)**: 1.71x improvement
- **Method**: Complete skill-by-skill counting for both systems

### **Processing Speed:** (Unchanged - Already Accurate)
- **V7.1**: 189.52 seconds per job
- **V14**: 29.1 seconds per job  
- **Improvement**: 6.52x faster

### **Reliability:** (Unchanged - Already Accurate)
- **V7.1**: 60% success rate (timeouts)
- **V14**: 100% success rate
- **Improvement**: Complete elimination of failures

## üîç **QA METHODOLOGY COMPLIANCE**

### **Dexi's Requirements Met:**
1. ‚úÖ **Same counting rules** for both V7.1 and V14
2. ‚úÖ **Complete transparency** in methodology
3. ‚úÖ **Job-by-job analysis** instead of aggregated totals
4. ‚úÖ **Verifiable results** with audit trail
5. ‚úÖ **Honest improvement factors** - no inflation

### **Teaching Applied:**
- **Dexi's Principle**: "Same counting rules for both systems, no exceptions"
- **Method**: Count every skill in every table for both systems
- **Result**: Honest, QA-acceptable baseline for production blessing

## üéØ **PRODUCTION IMPACT**

### **V14 Still Shows Strong Improvement:**
- **1.71x skills extraction** - Meaningful performance gain
- **6.52x processing speed** - Transformational user experience
- **100% reliability** - Eliminates V7.1 production failures
- **Enhanced categorization** - Better matching capabilities

### **Business Case Remains Strong:**
- 71% more skills identified per job
- Sub-30 second processing vs 3+ minutes
- Zero timeout failures in production
- Modern architecture for future scaling
