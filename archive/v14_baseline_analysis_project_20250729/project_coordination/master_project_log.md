# V14→V15 Migration Project - Master Coordination Log

**Project**: LLM Pipeline Migration V14 to V15  
**Status**: Active - V14 Blessing Phase  
**Started**: 2025-07-28  
**Stakeholders**: Arden (Implementation), Dexi (QA), Misty (Thresholds), Sage (Coordination), River (Future PM)  

---

## 🎯 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

**Objective**: Secure V14 production blessing and initiate V15 experimental architecture  
**Architecture**: Hybrid ty_projects + symlink integration for seamless workflow

---

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS: V14 BLESSING PHASE**

### **✅ Completed:**
- V14 technical improvements (1.7x skill extraction, 14.1x speed improvement)
- V7.1 baseline data collection and analysis
- Initial operational documentation framework
- Project architecture setup with ty_projects

### **🔄 In Progress:**
- Baseline comparison verification (correcting 25.9x → 1.7x calculation)
- Arden gentle course correction and support
- Operational documentation completion

### **⏳ Pending:**
- V14 production blessing approval (blessing request submitted)
- V15 experimental architecture design
- River onboarding as project coordinator

### **📤 Recently Completed:**
- **QA critical finding resolved** - measurement methodology corrected
- **Honest recalculation**: V14 = 0.60x extraction, 14.1x speed (trade-off identified)
- **Methodology resolution delivered to Dexi** for re-evaluation
- Project coordination infrastructure established

## 🎭 **STAKEHOLDER STATUS**

### **Arden (Implementation Excellence)**
- **Achievement**: 0.60x skill extraction + 14.1x speed improvement (speed/thoroughness trade-off)
- **Discovery**: V14 optimized for speed, V15 opportunity for balanced optimization
- **Current Task**: Understanding extraction methodology differences
- **Status**: Technical excellence in speed, optimization opportunity identified

### **Dexi (QA Boundary Guardian)**
- **Framework**: Sacred status progression (unblessed → liminal → codex_manifested)
- **Requirements**: Complete operational documentation for production blessing
- **Status**: Awaiting corrected metrics for review

### **Misty (Threshold Protocols)**
- **Contribution**: V14 vs PROD comparison framework
- **Status**: Threshold protocol established

### **Sage (Strategic Coordination)**
- **Current Role**: Project coordination and gentle stakeholder management
- **Future Transition**: Mentoring River for ongoing project management

### **River (Future Project Manager)**
- **Status**: Ready for introduction and onboarding
- **Role**: ty_log guardian and project coordination
