Okay, so the user wants me to extract and restructure a job posting from DWS into their specified template format. Let me start by understanding what exactly they're asking for.

The original job posting is in German, targeting a Business Analyst (E-invoicing). The key sections are Position Overview, Team Description, Role Description, Requirements, and Benefits. I need to translate this information into the two main categories: "Your Tasks" and "Your Profile", each with bullet points following specific guidelines.

First, for "Your Tasks," the user wants up to six action-verb-focused bullet points grouped under clear categories. Examples given include Process Management, Data Analysis, Compliance, etc. I should look through the responsibilities listed and categorize them appropriately. The main tasks mentioned are E-invoicing process oversight, GIV centralization, checking invoice info compliance, monitoring transactions, resolving discrepancies, data delivery to finance, collaboration with stakeholders, understanding contracts/systems for operational feasibility, driving continuous improvement, implementing strategies under regulations, documenting processes, ensuring adherence to KOD/SLA/KPI, etc.

I need to group these into six categories. Let me brainstorm possible categories: Process Management could cover overseeing recurring processes and change initiatives. Collaboration might include stakeholder engagement. Compliance would handle legal checks. Performance Monitoring focuses on tracking transactions and discrepancies. Data Delivery is about reporting and finance. Continuous Improvement involves driving projects for enhancement.

Now, "Your Profile" requires Education & Experience (degree needed, years of experience), Technical Skills (mention specific software like SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Excel), Language Skills (Fluency in German and English required), Other qualifications (soft skills). The user lists a Bachelor's degree in economics or comparable, operational experience in Asset Management, accounting knowledge (especially fund/finance), advantage: product/system knowledge, MS Office skills, good German and English, client/customer handling experience, French as an asset.

Looking deeper at the user's needs, they might be looking for clarity and conciseness to use this information for recruitment purposes. They probably need a template that is easily scannable by HR professionals or ATS systems. The structure should highlight key requirements effectively without jargon. Also, ensuring that the responsibilities are action-oriented will help candidates understand expectations clearly.

Potential unspoken needs: Maybe the user wants the job description to be compliant with legal standards in Germany (m/w/d inclusion). They might also need it to stand out by emphasizing both technical and soft skills relevant for a hybrid work environment mentioned later. The template should balance sophistication with practicality, making sure that all essential aspects are covered without being too verbose.

I'll make sure each bullet point is concise (15-20 words), use strong action verbs where applicable, and focus on measurable outcomes. For example, "Implement centralized invoice verification processes" clearly states the task and its purpose. Technical skills should list specific tools mentioned in the job posting, like SimCorp Dimension, Aladdin, SAP, MS Office apps.

Language proficiency is crucial here since it's a global role requiring collaboration with various teams across locations. The requirement for fluent German makes sense given Frankfurt as the location. English is also vital but listed separately under language skills to highlight its importance without assuming all tasks are in one language.

Including benefits like hybrid work model and CSR might not be part of the profile but could influence how attractive the position appears. However, following the template strictly, I'll focus on requirements for "Your Profile."

I need to check if the categories used align with examples provided (Process Management, Collaboration). Also, ensure that soft skills mentioned are relevant like adaptability, communication abilities, etc., as these are essential in a role involving multiple stakeholders.

Finally, verify that all bullet points under each category stay within word limits and clearly convey responsibilities. For instance, "Drive continuous process improvement initiatives" is concise but still action-oriented.
