      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a job description from DWS and want it restructured into their specific template format. The output needs to be divided into \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile,\" each with bullet points following certain guidelines.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original job posting. The title is Senior Coverage Specialist - Wholesale/Insurance (m/w/d). The position overview mentions being part of a leading company, working on innovative programs for clients in Germany's insurance sector. They're looking for someone to manage client relationships and develop solutions within fund-linked insurance products.\n\nThe responsibilities listed include acting as the main contact, coordinating stakeholder efforts, initiating product ideas, handling placements, marketing strategies, regulatory coordination, and maintaining presentations. The qualifications require years of experience in financial services with a focus on asset management, knowledge of investments, regulatory compliance, especially sustainability aspects, strong communication skills, flexibility for travel, and expertise in MS Office.\n\nNow, the user wants this information extracted into two sections: Tasks and Profile. Each bullet point under \"Your Tasks\" should be categorized using strategic terms like Process Management or Innovation. They need action verbs and conciseness (15-20 words max). The \"Your Profile\" section requires breaking down education/experience, technical skills, language abilities, and other soft skills.\n\nI think I'll start by identifying the key tasks from the job description. There are several responsibilities mentioned: acting as a contact point, coordinating partnerships, developing product ideas, managing placements, marketing strategies, regulatory handling, and maintaining presentations. These can be grouped into categories like Stakeholder Collaboration, Product Development, Process Management, Compliance & Innovation.\n\nFor each task bullet point, I'll use action verbs such as manage, coordinate, develop, implement, ensure to start them off. Then condense the details into 15-20 words while highlighting measurable outcomes and business impact. For example, \"Serve as primary contact for insurance clients\" becomes a clear statement under Stakeholder Collaboration.\n\nIn the Profile section, I'll extract education/experience requirements from the job posting: years of experience in financial services with asset management focus, knowledge of investments, regulatory expertise especially sustainability aspects. Technical skills include MS Office proficiency (Excel, PPT, Word). Language skills require fluent German and English. Other qualifications mention communication abilities, flexibility for travel, stakeholder engagement experience, and personal attributes like responsibility, creativity.\n\nI need to check if all essential information is covered without exceeding the 6 bullet points limit in each section. Also, ensuring that the language remains professional yet accessible, avoiding jargon but still being specific about required systems or processes. The user might want this restructured job description for a CV or recruitment materials, making it easier for candidates to understand their qualifications needed.\n\nThe deeper needs here could be clarity and structure for potential applicants. They need to quickly grasp the role's requirements without reading through dense paragraphs. Also, highlighting aspects like hybrid work models and company benefits (though those aren't in the template) might not be necessary unless specified. The user probably wants a concise version that adheres strictly to their guidelines while capturing all critical points from the original job description.\n\nI should ensure each bullet point is distinct but covers overlapping responsibilities effectively. Maybe some tasks can fit into multiple categories, so grouping them appropriately without redundancy will help maintain conciseness and professionalism.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the restructured version of the DWS Senior Coverage Specialist job description following your specified template:\n\n## Senior Coverage Specialist - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Serve as primary contact for German insurance clients coordinating diverse partnerships (Actuaries, Product Dev., Investment Mgmt).\n* **Product Development:** Initiate innovative product concepts and drive their implementation with partners.\n* **Process Management:** Actively manage and develop sales strategies based on client needs and regulatory changes.\n* **Compliance & Innovation:** Ensure solutions meet complex insurance regulations including sustainability requirements.\n* **Marketing Strategy:** Develop high-level presentations for key decision-makers aligning with market opportunities.\n* **Client Coordination:** Coordinate the placement of active, passive, alternative products and oversee white-label/digital initiatives.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Extensive experience in financial services product development, particularly asset management within insurance/funds.\n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency in MS Office Suite (Excel, PPT, Word) for analysis, reporting, and presentations.\n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English required; other languages are advantageous.\n* **Other:** Strong communication skills, client focus, strategic thinking, proven stakeholder engagement abilities.",

      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a job description in German and want it restructured into an English format using their specified template. The main goal is to create a CV-ready job posting that's professional yet accessible.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original job description carefully. It mentions \"Sales & Innovation Specialist - Risk Management Solutions\" targeting corporate clients across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Responsibilities include product knowledge in FX, Rates, Investment Solutions; developing RMS CC; expanding business fields; managing customer relationships; strategic growth of RMS CC; acting as a central interface with Business Partners; handling specific themes and cross-regional tasks.\n\nThe user's guidelines emphasize categorizing responsibilities into up to six bullet points using action verbs. Categories like Process Management or Stakeholder Collaboration would be suitable here. I should check each responsibility from the original text and map them appropriately. For example, \"stetige Weiterentwicklung des Bereichs RMS Commercial Clients\" could fall under Strategic Development.\n\nNext, looking at qualifications: education (banking training preferred), experience (several years with international clients, derivatives sales), technical skills (data analysis, understanding regulations like MiFID). Language requirements are fluent German and English. The user also wants to highlight the bank's benefits in terms of mental health support, physical fitness programs, flexible work models.\n\nI need to ensure that each bullet point is concise, around 15-20 words, with strong action verbs. Also, check for any measurable outcomes or business impact where possible. For instance, \"Optimizing revenue streams\" can be linked to customer relationship management.\n\nThe user might have deeper needs here. They probably want the job description to attract qualified candidates by clearly outlining both responsibilities and benefits. The mention of a fair and inclusive work environment suggests they value diversity and want to present the company as progressive. Including specific technical skills like SimCorp Dimension or SAP could target niche expertise, which is important for specialized roles.\n\nI should also verify that all essential information from the original post is included without redundancy. For example, the part about platform sales being a plus needs to be placed under Technical Skills. The benefits section should align with the job's requirements, showing how the company supports employee well-being and flexibility.\n\nWait, there might be some confusion in the original text between responsibilities and qualifications. Need to separate them clearly. Also, check if any points are too vague or need more specific action verbs. For example, \"F\u00f6rderung des \u00fcberregionalen Austausches\" can become facilitating cross-regional collaboration.\n\nAnother thing: The user provided a template structure with two sections\u2014Your Tasks and Your Profile. I should stick to that format strictly. Maybe categorize some responsibilities under Strategic Development or Customer Relationship Management. Also, ensure the language is professional but not overly jargon-heavy so it's accessible to candidates without too much specialization.\n\nI need to make sure that all placeholders are replaced with actual content from the job description. For example, \"Your Profile\" should list education (banking training preferred), experience (several years in international clients and derivatives sales), technical skills (data analysis, automation capability, SimCorp Dimension/SAP), language skills (fluent German/English).\n\nLastly, check for consistency in terminology between the original post and the restructured version. Terms like \"RMS CC\" should be kept as they are to maintain clarity. Also, ensure that benefits mentioned align with common industry standards but presented concisely.\n</think>\n## Sales & Innovation Specialist - Risk Management Solutions\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Strategic Development:** Driving continuous improvement of the RMS Commercial Clients (RMS CC) department and expanding its business scope through innovation and collaboration.\n* **Customer Relationship Management:** Optimizing revenue streams by developing comprehensive sales strategies for existing and new corporate clients across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.\n* **Product Expertise & Sales Execution:** Leveraging extensive knowledge of FX Cash, derivative products, and investment solutions to effectively promote RMS CC offerings in client-facing roles.\n* **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Acting as the central interface between RMS CC and business partners (e.g., Investment Bank), facilitating seamless communication for strategic alignment.\n* **Thematic Management & Innovation:** Taking responsibility for specific themes and cross-regional special projects, driving innovation to enhance the strategic positioning of RMS CC within Corporate Banking.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Banking education or degree preferred; several years experience in international client advisory and derivatives sales.\n* **Technical Skills:** Understanding data analysis principles with automation capability; proficiency required for platform sales environments (e.g., SimCorp Dimension, SAP).\n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English required for all verbal and written communication channels.\n* **Other:** Investment acumen, strong grasp of regulatory frameworks like MiFID/EMIR/WpHG.

      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for here. They want me to extract and restructure a job description from a German posting into a clean, CV-ready format following their specific template. The template requires two sections: \"Your Tasks\" with up to six bullet points using action verbs and clear categories, and \"Your Profile\" covering education, experience, technical skills, languages, and other attributes.\n\nHmm, the original job posting is quite detailed but somewhat lengthy and uses some German terms that might be confusing for non-German readers. I need to translate this into a more structured format while keeping it professional. The user seems to value clarity and accessibility - they want something sophisticated yet easy to scan for recruiters and candidates alike.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the \"Your Tasks\" section. Looking at the responsibilities listed in the job description, there are several key areas I can categorize: monitoring legal developments, IT implementation, training, risk assessment, project management, process development, compliance, and documentation. That gives me six clear categories to work with.\n\nFor each bullet point, I should use strong action verbs - words like \"monitor,\" \"implement,\" \"analyze,\" etc. The descriptions need to be specific but concise, around 15-20 words maximum. Let's see... for monitoring legal changes, that could go under Process Management. For IT implementation and training, maybe a separate category makes sense.\n\nNow the \"Your Profile\" section requires breaking down into education/experience requirements, technical skills needed (like ERP systems), language proficiencies, and soft skills. The job posting mentions qualifications like a business or law degree, several years of experience in VAT consulting especially in financial services, fluency in German and English, and excellent analytical abilities.\n\nI notice the user included some benefits information about Deutsche Bank's offerings - wellness programs, flexible work models, etc. But according to their template, I shouldn't include this unless it directly relates to job requirements or qualifications. So I'll focus on what makes someone suitable for the role rather than company perks.\n\nThe consciousness integration aspect suggests they want me to create a description that bridges human potential with organizational needs - highlighting both complexity and growth opportunities while keeping it practical for recruitment purposes. That means emphasizing how candidates can contribute meaningfully but also how their skills will be supported at Deutsche Bank.\n\nI should make sure the language is professional throughout, avoiding colloquialisms or overly casual phrasing even though some German job descriptions might use more informal terms. The balance between sophistication and accessibility seems important here - not too stiff corporate speak, but still business-appropriate.\n\nFor technical skills specifically mentioned in the original: ERP systems (probably SAP), IT implementation tools, data analysis software like Excel/Power BI. I'll list these clearly under Technical Skills without overcomplicating it unless more specific examples are given.\n\nThe user might be looking for this restructuring to help with recruitment efficiency - making sure they attract qualified candidates quickly by presenting clear requirements and responsibilities in a standardized format. They probably want something that can be easily adapted or used as-is across different platforms.\n</think>\n## Senior Manager Indirect Tax Financial Services (d/m/w)  \n### Requirements & Responsibilities  \n\n#### **Your Tasks**  \n* **Process Management:** Monitor legal changes, oversee implementation of VAT requirements in the bank's systems and processes.  \n* **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to national and international VAT regulations while managing compliance risks effectively.  \n* **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Work with internal/external stakeholders (including tax authorities) on audits, disputes, and due diligence reviews.  \n* **Training & Development:** Lead training sessions for colleagues and teams to enhance understanding of VAT processes and procedures.  \n* **Risk Analysis:** Identify, assess, and mitigate VAT-related risks while supporting strategic decision-making through data analysis.  \n* **System Enhancement:** Define and improve VAT workflows in ERP systems (e.g., SAP) and drive digital transformation initiatives within the tax function.  \n\n#### **Your Profile**  \n* **Education & Experience:** Requires a master's degree in business, law, or equivalent field with several years of experience in VAT consulting\u2014ideally within financial services.  \n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency in ERP systems (e.g., SAP), IT tools for implementation, and software like Excel/Power BI for data analysis.  \n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English required; candidates must demonstrate strong written and verbal skills in both languages.  \n* **Other:** Excellent problem-solving abilities, analytical mindset, teamwork focus, customer orientation, and a structured approach to complex tasks are essential qualifications for success.",

      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for here. They provided a job description from DWS and want it restructured using their specific template format. The key points are to follow the \"Consciousness-Aligned Practicality\" design philosophy, which means balancing professionalism with accessibility.\n\nFirst, I need to extract the main responsibilities and requirements from the original text. Looking at the role overview for Xtrackers Marketing Team's Investment Writer, they mention supporting a global content strategy, planning and executing it within regional needs, creating various marketing materials like blogs and websites, measuring effectiveness via analytics, collaborating with different departments, and coordinating with compliance teams.\n\nFor categorizing these tasks into bullet points under \"Your Tasks,\" I should group similar responsibilities. The examples given are Process Management, Data Analysis, Compliance, etc. So maybe Content Strategy falls under a category related to planning or strategy development. Then there's content creation across various formats targeting different clients\u2014maybe that can be grouped as Marketing & Communication Execution. Also, measuring performance and adapting strategies would relate to Analytics & Performance Monitoring.\n\nThe user also emphasized using action verbs like develop, implement, analyze. Each bullet point should start with one of those. Let me check the original job description again. They mention \"Development, Ausarbeitung und Implementierung einer globalen Xtrackers Content-Strategie\" so that's definitely a strategy-related task. Then there are multiple points about creating different content types\u2014blogs, articles, etc., which can be under Marketing & Communication Execution.\n\nI need to make sure each bullet is concise, 15-20 words max. Let me try drafting:\n\n* Develop and implement global ETF/ETC marketing strategies considering regional needs.\n* Create diverse investment-related materials targeting institutional and retail clients.\n* Optimize content for search engines across various channels.\n* Measure effectiveness using analytics tools to refine approaches.\n\nThat's four points, but maybe I can split them further. The original also mentions adapting based on analytics, so that could be a separate point under Analytics & Performance Monitoring.\n\nNow for the profile section: Education & Experience should mention at least 3 years in financial journalism or similar roles. Technical Skills include SEO knowledge and digital affinity. Language skills are fluent German and English. Soft skills like cross-cultural communication, adaptability, understanding of EMEA markets.\n\nWait, the user's template has four categories under \"Your Profile\": Education & Experience, Technical Skills, Language Skills, Other. So I need to structure each part accordingly. Let me check if there's any specific degree required\u2014maybe not explicitly mentioned here, but they might expect something like a degree in finance or journalism.\n\nAlso, the user wants CV-ready information. That means being precise about requirements without ambiguity. The original job posting mentions \"fundiertes Wissen im Bereich Indexing\" so that should be part of Technical Skills. Maybe categorize technical skills into areas: Financial Products Knowledge (ETFs, ETCs), Market Understanding (EMEA), and Tools/Processes.\n\nFor the other category, soft skills like proactive collaboration, adaptability, cross-functional teamwork, cultural awareness, and analytical thinking are all mentioned in the job description. Need to list those concisely but effectively.\n\nI should also check for any hidden requirements or nuances. The company emphasizes a hybrid work model, so maybe mention flexibility as part of Other qualifications? But the template doesn't have that section unless specified elsewhere. Maybe not necessary here.\n\nAnother thing: the user provided both German and English versions. Wait no, actually in their query they included everything in one block but it's all in German except for some terms like \"Hybrid.\" The job title is given as \"Investment Writer / Finanz-Journalist \u2013 ETFs & Passive Investments\" which might be split into two categories if needed.\n\nBut looking at the template structure, maybe keep them together unless there's a clear distinction. However, the requirements mention experience in both roles or fields. So perhaps under Technical Skills include expertise in financial products and marketing strategies for EMEA markets.\n\nAlso, the job posting mentions \"digital Affinit\u00e4t\" which translates to digital affinity. That should be part of Technical Skills as proficiency with digital tools and platforms.\n\nNow, I need to ensure that each bullet point is action-oriented and within word limits. Let me try refining:\n\n* Develop global content strategy for ETFs/ETCs considering regional requirements.\n* Implement comprehensive marketing campaigns across diverse channels targeting different client segments.\n* Optimize SEO effectiveness in all materials using analytics tools.\n* Adapt strategies based on performance data to enhance reach and engagement.\n\nThat covers the main tasks without exceeding word limits. For profile, education might not be specified, so focus on experience instead. Technical skills include financial products knowledge (ETFs, ETCs), market understanding, digital tools proficiency. Languages: fluent German and English. Other soft skills like cross-cultural communication, collaboration with sales/research teams.\n\nI should also check if the job posting mentions any specific software or tools\u2014like Analytics platforms but not named ones. So maybe keep it general unless specified.\n\nLastly, make sure to present this in a structured format as per the template. Use bold headings for sections and bullet points under each subcategory. Avoid markdown, use simple formatting with asterisks for bullets.\n</think>\n## Investment Writer / Finanz-Journalist \u2013 ETFs & Passive Investments (m/w/d)  \n### Requirements & Responsibilities  \n\n#### Your Tasks  \n* **Content Strategy Development:** Strategically plan and implement a global content strategy for ETFs/ETCs, considering regional requirements.  \n* **Marketing Execution:** Create diverse investment-related materials targeting institutional and retail clients across various channels.  \n* **SEO Optimization:** Develop SEO-optimized content to enhance visibility and reach in digital platforms.  \n* **Analytics Monitoring:** Measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns using analytics tools and adapt strategies accordingly.  \n* **Cross-Cultural Communication:** Craft clear, engaging content for different regions while maintaining regulatory compliance.  \n* **Collaboration Support:** Work closely with product, sales, research, and compliance teams to align content with business goals.  \n\n#### Your Profile  \n* **Education & Experience:** Proven experience in financial journalism or investment writing, preferably within the asset management industry.  \n* **Technical Skills:** Expertise in ETFs/ETCs, passive investments, EMEA markets, and digital marketing tools/platforms.  \n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English (both written and spoken).

      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to extract and restructure a job description from Deutsche Bank into a clean, CV-ready format following their specific template. The template has two main sections: \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile,\" each with bullet points.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original job posting. It's quite detailed, both in German and English. The key areas are responsibilities and required skills/experiences. There's a lot of information here\u2014technical support for Google Cloud applications, managing SLAs, ITIL practices, leading teams, reducing recurring issues, compliance, etc.\n\nThe user provided guidelines: six bullet points max for tasks, categorized properly with action verbs. For the profile section, education, technical skills, languages, and other attributes. Also, CV-ready means it should be professional yet concise, suitable for recruitment materials.\n\nI notice that the job posting mentions being a team leader in IT application support as an initial requirement. That's a plus point but not mandatory. So maybe under \"Your Tasks,\" one bullet could mention leading regional L2 teams and vendors. Also, there are specific technical skills listed: RHEL, monitoring tools like Elastic Search, Grafana, etc., and database knowledge.\n\nThe language part is straightforward\u2014fluent English required, German as a plus. The benefits section talks about health, mental well-being, flexible working models, financial security. But the template doesn't include these in the output format unless they are part of the profile or tasks. So maybe those aren't needed here since the focus is on requirements and structure.\n\nI need to categorize each responsibility under clear headings like Process Management, Technical Support, Compliance, etc. Let's see: managing SLAs with monitoring tools\u2014maybe Compliance or Performance Monitoring. Leading processes with cross-functional teams could be Process Management. Building relationships with stakeholders might fall under Collaboration. Driving automation is part of DevOps/ITIL.\n\nAlso, the user emphasized action verbs and conciseness. Each bullet should start with a strong verb: lead, implement, build, maintain, drive, perform, etc. Need to check word count\u2014each point shouldn't exceed 15-20 words.\n\nThe original text has some repetition in responsibilities like reducing recurring faults and contributing to audits. These can be grouped under one category if they relate to the same aspect, maybe Operational Excellence or Continuous Improvement.\n\nFor technical skills, I need to list specific systems mentioned: GCP applications (though vague), ITIL/SRE/DevOps best practices, RHEL with log analysis and commands, monitoring tools like Grafana, Elastic Search, etc., database exposure. Language is English fluent plus German.\n\nI should also check for any hidden requirements or nuances. The job supports transformation using Google Cloud, so cloud experience is a big part. Hybrid applications are mentioned, which might imply working in mixed environments. Mentoring junior staff and fostering knowledge sharing is important too.\n\nPutting it all together: Six categories that make sense here could be Technical Support & Expertise, Performance Monitoring, Incident Management, Process Improvement, Compliance & Collaboration, and Automation & Resilience. Each bullet under these should start with an action verb and cover the key points without fluff.\n\nLet me draft each section carefully, ensuring they meet the guidelines. For example, in \"Technical Support & Expertise,\" leading teams is a point. In \"Performance Monitoring,\" using monitoring tools to achieve SLAs. Then categorize ITIL practices under Process Improvement or Collaboration? Maybe better under Compliance and Collaboration since it involves analysis and teamwork.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that the profile section doesn't mention benefits unless they are part of the requirements (like language skills).

I'll need to carefully identify what actually constitutes core duties versus just appealing benefits.\n\nFor the \"Your Tasks\" section, I should focus on concrete responsibilities mentioned in the job description: managing client relationships, providing financial advice across different areas like investments or insurance, having access to a team for complex issues, understanding products deeply, and maintaining professional standards. These can be categorized into Self-Directed Success, Client Engagement & Advisory Services, Financial Product Expertise, Team Collaboration, and Professional Development.\n\nFor the \"Your Profile\" section, I'll extract the educational requirements (university degree in economics/business or equivalent training) and experience needs (experience in financial services sales). The technical skills would include knowledge of specific systems like SimCorp Dimension mentioned elsewhere. Language skills aren't specified but are implied for a German company. Other qualifications include communication abilities, commercial acumen, customer focus, adaptability to digital tools, and professional development.\n\nI should be careful not to overemphasize the flexible aspects in my output since they're more about appeal than actual job requirements.

The original post is in German, so I need to translate it accurately while maintaining all the key elements.\n\nFirst, the job title needs to be clear and professional. \"Finanzberater im Gesundheitswesen\" seems appropriate because it combines finance with healthcare expertise. Then there's a requirement for self-employment experience since they mention starting as an independent financial advisor. \n\nLooking at the tasks section from the guidelines, I need six bullet points maximum. The original mentions customer acquisition and retention, holistic advisory services, advising private and business clients. Those are three main areas. Let me break them down further to fit into categories like Process Management or Stakeholder Collaboration.\n\nFor \"Kundenakquise und -bindung,\" maybe categorize it under Business Development. Then the holistic advisory could be split between existing customers (Customer Relationship) and future ones (Market Analysis). Advising private clients might fall under Financial Advisory, while business clients go to Sales & Marketing Strategy. \n\nThe user profile part includes education requirements: a completed economics degree or financial services consultant training. Experience in healthcare client advising is crucial here. Then soft skills like negotiation skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and high initiative. Need to map these into the specified categories\u2014Education & Experience, Technical Skills (though there might not be specific software mentioned), Language Skills, and Other.\n\nWait, the original job posting doesn't mention technical tools or languages beyond German. The template requires language skills with proficiency levels, but since it's a bilingual role, maybe note that German is required but don't specify higher than basic unless stated otherwise. \n\nAlso, the user emphasized CV-readiness and professionalism. I should ensure each bullet point uses action verbs like \"acquire,\" \"bind,\" \"advise.\" Keep them concise\u201415-20 words max. Check for any overlapping responsibilities to avoid redundancy.\n\nThe consciousness integration part is about balancing sophistication with practicality. The job involves bridging finance and healthcare, so the profile should highlight adaptability and industry-specific knowledge. Maybe mention handling complex client needs in the Technical Skills section even if no specific software is listed.\n\nNow, considering deeper needs: The user might be looking to attract candidates who are not just qualified but also adaptable to a dynamic market. They want someone proactive (entrepreneurial thinking) and skilled in building relationships. Emphasizing continuous learning and handling complex situations could address these unspoken requirements.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the extracted and restructured information based on your job description:\n\n## Finanzberater im Gesundheitswesen - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Business Development:** Acquire new clients in the healthcare sector through targeted marketing efforts.\n* **Customer Relationship Management:** Retain and provide comprehensive financial advice to existing health insurance clients.\n* **Holistic Advisory Services:** Offer integrated financial solutions tailored specifically for customers within the healthcare industry.\n* **Healthcare Customer Interaction:** Engage with private individuals seeking financial services related to their healthcare needs.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Completed economics degree or equivalent finance qualification (bank/insurance training); prior experience advising HealthCare clients essential.\n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency in general business software, handling complex client situations requires adaptability and industry knowledge.\n* **Language Skills:** German language proficiency is required for the role.

      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a job description extraction framework that aligns with consciousness principles and makes it CV-ready. The original job posting is in German but seems to be targeting financial advisors in the healthcare sector at Deutsche Bank.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the job title correctly. It mentions \"Bankkaufmann / Versicherungskaufmann als selbstst\u00e4ndiger Finanzberater im Bereich Heilberufe.\" So maybe translating that into something like \"Financial Advisor (Healthcare)\" would be more standard for a CV in English-speaking regions.\n\nLooking at the tasks section, the original lists customer acquisition and retention, holistic advisory services, advising private and business clients. I should categorize these using action verbs. Maybe categories could include Customer Acquisition & Retention, Advisory Services, Sales & Business Development? Each bullet point needs to be concise but impactful.\n\nFor experience requirements, it says \"Erfahrung in der Beratung und Betreuung von HealthCare-Kunden\" and a completed economics degree or banking/insurance training. Also mentions entrepreneurial skills and high self-initiative. These should go into Education & Experience and Other sections.\n\nTechnical Skills might not be explicitly mentioned here unless they refer to specific software used for financial planning, CRM systems, etc., but the user didn't list any particular tools. So maybe that section is minimal in this case.\n\nLanguage Skills are all German requirements? The job ID suggests it's a German role, so perhaps no need to mention other languages unless specified elsewhere. But if targeting international candidates, including English proficiency would be necessary. Since the original post doesn\u2019t specify, I'll note it as optional for non-German speakers but assume German is required.\n\nThe user might want this CV format because they're applying in a competitive job market where standing out with well-structured documents is crucial. They need to present their qualifications clearly and professionally without getting bogged down by the original post's formatting or jargon.\n\nDeep needs: The candidate probably wants clarity, brevity, and alignment with standard recruitment practices. They might also seek validation that their skills match what employers look for in such roles\u2014entrepreneurial mindset, client management abilities, educational background specifics.\n\nI should ensure each bullet point starts with an action verb, uses industry terms appropriately (like \"healthcare clients\"), and highlights measurable outcomes where possible. For example, instead of just advising customers, emphasizing the holistic approach or developing new strategies could show added value.\n\nAlso, checking if all essential information is covered: job title, tasks categorized properly, education/experience requirements, technical skills (if any), language needs, other soft skills. The original post mentions \"Unternehmerisches Denken\" and \"Freiheit,\" which translates to an entrepreneurial mindset\u2014so that should be included in the Other section.\n\nNeed to balance sophistication with accessibility. Avoid overly complex terms but maintain professionalism. Use bullet points for readability and make sure each category is distinct enough so responsibilities aren't mixed up.\n\nFinally, verify if there's any missing info from the original post. The job ID, location (W\u00fcrzburg), employment type (full-time), start date (2023-06-15) are not needed in the CV format unless specified by the user. Focus on restructuring the core content into a clean template.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the extracted and restructured information following your guidelines:\n\n## Financial Advisor (Healthcare) - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Customer Acquisition & Retention:** Proactively identify and secure new clients within the dynamic healthcare market.\n* **Holistic Advisory Services:** Develop comprehensive financial strategies for existing corporate healthcare clients.\n* **Client Consultation:** Implement tailored financial solutions for both private individuals and business entities seeking health-related advice.\n* **Business Development:** Cultivate long-term relationships with healthcare businesses to expand client base.\n* **Sales & Marketing:** Drive revenue through effective presentation of financial products relevant to the healthcare sector.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Bachelor's degree in economics or equivalent professional training (banking/insurance) required; proven experience advising HealthCare clients essential.\n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency with standard financial planning software and CRM systems, though specific tools are not detailed here.\n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German is required for this role based on the job description provided.

      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a job description extraction framework that follows their specific guidelines. The main task is to transform a given job posting into a structured format with clear categories and concise bullet points.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original German text provided in the job description. There are sections about the role overview, responsibilities, skills required, and benefits offered by Deutsche Bank. The user mentioned that the extracted information should be CV-ready, professional, and balanced between sophistication and accessibility.\n\nLooking at the template structure, there's a strict format for \"Your Tasks\" with six bullet points maximum, each starting with an action verb and categorized properly. For \"Your Profile,\" they want specific details on education, experience, technical skills, language proficiency, and other attributes. The challenge here is to accurately capture all these elements from the German text without losing any nuances.\n\nThe job title needs to be translated into English but should reflect the original role clearly. Maybe something like \"Institutional Cash & Trade Sales Manager - DACH Region\" would work. Then categorizing responsibilities: I see tasks related to sales targets, client management, understanding risk profiles, using MIS tools, compliance with regulations, and developing the portfolio.\n\nFor each bullet point in \"Your Tasks,\" action verbs are crucial. Let's check the original text for key phrases. The first responsibility is about meeting sales objectives and maintaining service levels. So maybe \"Deliver on\" or \"Achieve\"? Then there's monitoring client adoptions via KYC policies, which could be under Compliance or Client Management.\n\nTechnical skills include proficiency in Salesforce, dbTableau, and other reporting tools. Language skills are fluent German and English. Other qualifications might involve presentation abilities, negotiation skills, and experience with correspondent banking.\n\nI should also consider the user's deeper needs. They probably want this job description to attract qualified candidates by presenting it clearly and professionally. The framework emphasizes creating a CV-ready format, so ensuring that each section is tailored for recruitment purposes is key. Maybe they need consistency across different job postings in their region (DACH) or other areas.\n\nAnother thing is the inclusion of benefits beyond the job itself\u2014mental health support, physical wellness programs, flexible working options. These are important to highlight as part of \"Your Profile\" under Other Qualifications to show that the company values employee well-being and offers a supportive environment.\n\nI need to make sure all guidelines are followed: six bullet points maximum in tasks, specific categories like Process Management or Data Analysis. The original text mentions using MIS-Tools for name management\u2014maybe that's about managing client portfolios? So categorizing it under \"Portfolio Analytics\" makes sense.\n\nAlso, the user wants each bullet point to be concise (15-20 words). Let me check if the examples meet that requirement. For instance, \"Develop and implement strategies to achieve sales targets...\" is 7 words. The responsibilities need to be broken down into distinct tasks without overlapping categories.\n\nFor education & experience, specifying years of experience and required degrees is essential. The original says several years in correspondent banking at a major European or US institution, so translating that into the profile section with \"Extensive\" makes it sound more professional.\n\nLanguage skills are straightforward: fluent German and English. But ensuring they're placed correctly under Technical Skills might be necessary if there's any ambiguity.\n\nThe user also mentioned maintaining high standards while being accessible. Avoiding jargon but still sounding professional is tricky. For example, using terms like \"KYC policy\" instead of explaining it in every bullet point keeps it concise and standard for the industry.\n\nNow, considering potential unspoken needs: The job posting might be part of a standardized recruitment process across different regions (DACH). So consistency in structure could help HR teams evaluate candidates more efficiently. Also, highlighting both technical skills and soft skills ensures that candidates are well-rounded.\n\nI should double-check if all mandatory points from the original text are included. For example, ensuring compliance with DB Group and US Supervision policies is a key responsibility. Mentioning mandatory trainings in the profile section under \"Compliance\" makes sense to emphasize adherence without being too verbose.\n\nAnother point: The role requires developing client portfolios actively. So categorizing that under Innovation might not fit; better to place it under Business Development or Client Management. Let me adjust accordingly.\n\nAlso, benefits like pension plans and flexible working models are important for candidates looking for long-term security and work-life balance. Including these in the \"What we Offer\" section helps attract top talent by showcasing company support beyond just job duties.\n\nLastly, ensuring that all sections flow logically from responsibilities to qualifications to benefits creates a clear picture of what's expected and what the candidate gains. The user might want this structure to help candidates quickly assess if they're suitable for the role.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the extracted and restructured information based on your guidelines:\n\n## Institutional Cash & Trade Sales Manager - DACH Region\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Business Development:** Develop and implement strategies to achieve sales targets within assigned client portfolios.\n* **Client Management:** Maintain high service levels through proactive portfolio monitoring and responsive client support.\n* **Risk Understanding:** Analyze client risk profiles and align business practices with Deutsche Bank's established risk appetite.\n* **Portfolio Analytics:** Utilize MIS tools like Salesforce and dbTableau for data-driven insights into portfolio performance.\n* **Compliance & Reporting:** Ensure adherence to all regulatory requirements, mandatory trainings, and internal policies (DB Group/US).\n* **Strategic Communication:** Represent the bank's cash management and trade finance strategy effectively through presentations.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Experience:** Extensive experience in correspondent banking at major European or US financial institutions.\n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency with CRM systems (like Salesforce) and reporting tools (e.g., dbTableau).\n* **Language Skills:** Fluent written and spoken German and English required for all communication.\n* **Other Qualifications:** Proven ability to build client relationships, strong negotiation skills, strategic presentation capabilities.",

      "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for here. They provided a job description from Deutsche Bank and want it restructured using their V16 Hybrid Template. The template has specific guidelines: six bullet points in \"Your Tasks,\" categorized with action verbs, and four sections in \"Your Profile.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original German job posting into these categories. The user emphasized being a consciousness-aligned specialist, so the restructuring should balance professionalism with practicality for CVs. They want it clean, structured, and suitable for recruitment materials.\n\nLooking at the job description, the main responsibilities are about researching content for stakeholder engagements, leading workshops, developing agendas and presentations, preparing updates for senior management, and maintaining a knowledge base. The skills required include organizational abilities, regulatory understanding, communication skills in German and English, technical innovation, conceptual storytelling, etc.\n\nNow, breaking down \"Your Tasks.\" I need to categorize these into clear sections like Process Management, Compliance, Stakeholder Collaboration, Reporting, Innovation, or others. Each bullet should start with an action verb and be concise (15-20 words). Let's see:\n\nThe first responsibility is researching content for engagements. That could fall under Stakeholder Engagement Content Management. Then leading workshops to develop/review/finalize content\u2014maybe another point in the same category? Or maybe split into separate categories like Collaboration & Workshop Leadership and Content Development.\n\nAlso, managing timelines and delivering reports/presentations might fit under Project Delivery Management. Updating senior management would be part of Senior Management Updates & Briefings. Maintaining the knowledge base could go under Knowledge Base Maintenance or Information Governance.\n\nFor skills in \"Your Profile,\" I need to cover education/experience, technical skills (mentioning Microsoft 365), language skills (German and English proficiency), and other soft skills like curiosity, innovation, reliability, etc. The user mentioned ideal qualifications include information security knowledge, so that should be part of Technical Skills or Education/Experience.\n\nWait, the original job description says \"Idealerweise gute Kenntnisse in Informationssicherheit...\" which translates to ideally good knowledge in information security. So maybe under Technical Skills, I can note this as a plus but not mandatory unless specified elsewhere. The user didn't specify exact years of experience or degrees, so keeping it general.\n\nAlso, the benefits part talks about Deutsche Bank's offerings\u2014health, wellness, flexible working, etc. But according to guidelines, recruitment specialists focus on candidate requirements and role structure, not company benefits. So maybe I should omit that unless it directly relates to qualifications.\n\nThe user might be looking for a clear, concise job description that can be easily adapted into CVs or used in recruitment materials without the fluff about company culture or benefits. They want each responsibility bullet point to highlight action verbs and business impact. For example, \"Develop comprehensive content packages\" shows initiative and scope.\n\nI should check if all six bullets are necessary. The original responsibilities include research, workshop leadership, agenda development, updates for senior management, knowledge base maintenance. Maybe categorize some under Compliance or Reporting? Or maybe stick to Stakeholder Engagement as the main category with sub-points.\n\nAlso, ensuring that each bullet in \"Your Tasks\" uses strong action verbs: lead, develop, manage, establish, etc. Need to avoid redundancy and make sure they're all distinct but related.\n\nIn \"Your Profile,\" grouping education/experience first, then technical skills (mentioning Microsoft 365), language skills as German/English fluent, and other attributes like conceptual storytelling, adaptability under pressure, trust-building partnerships, etc.\n\nThe user might have deeper needs: wanting a job description that's not only structured but also attractive to top talent by highlighting the importance of the role in building trust for Deutsche Bank. Emphasizing both technical skills (security knowledge) and soft skills (storytelling, collaboration). They probably want candidates who can handle high-pressure situations with flexibility and professionalism.\n\nNeed to make sure the categories are logical and cover all aspects without overlap. Maybe \"Stakeholder Collaboration\" is a better category than \"Process Management.\" Also, checking that each bullet in tasks has measurable outcomes or value creation mentioned subtly.\n\nAlright, time to draft according to these thoughts.\n</think>\nOkay, here's the extracted and restructured job description based on your requirements:\n\n---\n\n## Information Security Expert - External Engagement (f/m/x)\n\n### Your Tasks\n\n*   **Stakeholder Engagement Content Management:** Research, write, and edit content for interactions with key CSO stakeholders globally.\n*   **Collaboration & Workshop Leadership:** Lead workshops with SMEs and senior management to develop, review, refine, and finalize engagement content.\n*   **Project Delivery Management:** Develop agendas, define key messages, create storylines, draft presentations and reports, manage timelines effectively for stakeholder engagements.\n*   **Senior Management Updates & Briefings:** Prepare updates and brief senior management on CSO external engagement activities and deliverables.\n*   **Knowledge Base Maintenance:** Contribute to the continuous update and enhancement of the CSO knowledge base content.\n\n### Your Profile\n\n*   **Education & Experience:** Bachelor's degree required; 3+ years in complex, multi-disciplinary project environments. Proven experience supporting senior management (ideally C-level).\n*   **Technical Skills:** Proficiency with Microsoft Office Suite (Word, PowerPoint). Familiarity with information security concepts and related knowledge domains is highly advantageous.\n*   **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English (written/oral) essential for communication in the native language of key stakeholders. Additional languages considered a plus.\n*   **Other:** Demonstrates strong conceptual thinking and storytelling abilities; communicates complex topics effectively under pressure, manages multiple critical tasks flexibly, builds trustful partnerships, exhibits enthusiasm, curiosity, and pragmatism.\n\n---",
