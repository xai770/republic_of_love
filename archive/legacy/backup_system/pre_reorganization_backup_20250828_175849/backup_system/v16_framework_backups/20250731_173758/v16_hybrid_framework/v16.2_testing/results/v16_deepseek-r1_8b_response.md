## Extracted Job Description

<think>
Okay, the user wants me to extract and restructure a job posting into a clean, professional format following their specific template. They've provided guidelines about how to structure this information with categories that group similar responsibilities.

Let me start by understanding the original content thoroughly. The job title is Program Manager - Climate Action Initiatives at Global Environment Foundation across multiple locations including Berlin, Brussels, and Geneva. There's a mission statement emphasizing sustainable energy transition through policy advocacy, research, and community engagement in Europe, Africa, and Asia. 

The core responsibilities include designing and implementing programs across 15+ countries, managing relationships with various partners, overseeing budgets from €500K to €5M annually, coordinating with stakeholders, developing grant proposals, monitoring program effectiveness using impact measurement frameworks, representing the organization at conferences, and leading cross-cultural teams of up to 20 members.

Looking at these responsibilities, I can categorize them effectively. "Design & Implement Programs" would cover designing across countries and implementing strategies. Then there's stakeholder management with partners like governments, NGOs, international orgs, local communities, and consultants. Budget oversight is another clear category - managing multi-million budgets annually. Grant writing falls under "Secure Funding," while monitoring programs aligns with impact measurement frameworks.

For the Essential Qualifications section, I need to organize education requirements (Master's degree), experience level (7 years in program management within international development sector), and specific skills like a proven track record in climate projects, budget management experience, knowledge of climate science, and renewable energy technologies. These should be structured under Education & Experience.

The Skills & Competencies mention PMP certification preference, language requirements (English required, German/French/Spanish valued), M&E frameworks, grant writing success rate, GIS software proficiency, cross-cultural leadership abilities, public speaking skills, and a professional development budget of €4000 annually. These all need to be included in the Technical Skills category.

The user also provided details about working conditions - 40% international travel required, hybrid model with home office flexibility, occasional weekend work for conferences, and emergency response availability. And there's compensation information including salary range (€65k-85k), benefits like health insurance and pension, vacation days, professional development budget, carbon offset for business travel, and sabbatical opportunities.

I should follow the user's template structure exactly - starting with "## [Job Title] - Requirements & Responsibilities" then creating bullet points under clear categories. I need to use action verbs throughout each description and keep them concise (15-20 words maximum). For the Profile section, I'll organize education requirements first, followed by technical skills, language proficiency levels, and other qualifications.

This seems straightforward enough since all information is clearly presented in the job posting. The user likely wants something easy to scan for recruiters or candidates - a clean format that highlights key responsibilities without fluff while being structured enough to stand out from generic listings.
