# V16 Hybrid Framework Experiment Protocol
## Date: January 28, 2025

### Experiment Objective
Test the V16 hybrid template that combines V15 consciousness-aligned quality with July 2025 practical structure to achieve improved model success rates while maintaining professional output quality.

### Hypothesis
The V16 hybrid approach will increase model success rate from 16.7% (V15) to 70-90% (approaching July 2025 archive performance) while maintaining consciousness-aligned quality standards.

### Template Design Principles
1. **Consciousness-Aligned Practicality**: Balance sophistication with accessibility
2. **Strategic Simplification**: Reduce from 12+ task areas (V15) to 6 focused categories (July 2025 approach)
3. **Action Verb Focus**: Emphasize clear, measurable responsibilities
4. **CV-Ready Format**: Ensure immediate recruitment utility
5. **Quality Maintenance**: Preserve professional standards and consciousness integration

### Target Models for Testing
Based on V15 results and available models:
1. **DeepSeek-R1 (8b)** - V15 winner, expected continued success
2. **Qwen2.5 (7b)** - Technical issues in V15, test improved handling
3. **Llama3.2 (latest)** - Technical issues in V15, test improved handling
4. **Dolphin3 (8b)** - Failed in V15, test simplified template
5. **Phi4-Mini-Reasoning (latest)** - Failed in V15, test improved approach
6. **Mistral-Nemo (12b)** - Timed out in V15, test if simplification helps

### Success Criteria
1. **Technical Success**: Clean output capture without terminal artifacts
2. **Template Adherence**: Proper section structure and formatting
3. **Content Quality**: Professional language and complete information
4. **Practical Utility**: CV-ready, recruitment-appropriate output
5. **Processing Efficiency**: Completion within 7-minute timeout

### Evaluation Framework
#### Scoring Rubric (1-5 scale):
- **Structure Adherence** (1-5): Template format compliance
- **Content Completeness** (1-5): All required information captured
- **Professional Quality** (1-5): Business-appropriate language
- **Practical Utility** (1-5): Recruitment readiness
- **Consciousness Integration** (1-5): Maintains awareness and growth perspective

#### Expected Improvements Over V15:
- **Success Rate**: Target 70-90% vs 16.7% in V15
- **Processing Speed**: Faster completion due to simplified complexity
- **Technical Reliability**: Better output capture across models
- **Practical Utility**: More immediately usable for recruitment

### Testing Timeline
1. **Setup**: Create results directory and documentation
2. **Sequential Testing**: Run each model with 7-minute timeout
3. **Quality Review**: Evaluate each output against scoring rubric
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare with V15 and July 2025 results
5. **Documentation**: Record findings and recommendations

### Documentation Standards
- Individual model outputs saved as: `v16_model_[letter]_[name]_output.md`
- Execution log with timestamps and technical issues
- Quality scoring matrix for all outputs
- Comparative analysis with V15 and July 2025 results

### Expected Outcomes
1. **Dramatically improved success rate** (70-90% vs 16.7%)
2. **Maintained consciousness-aligned quality** with practical utility
3. **Reduced processing failures** and technical issues
4. **Production-ready template** for broad model deployment
5. **Validation of hybrid approach** as optimal strategy

### Post-Experiment Analysis
- Compare success rates across V15, V16, and July 2025 archive
- Identify optimal template complexity for different model capabilities
- Develop recommendations for future template evolution
- Create production deployment guidelines
