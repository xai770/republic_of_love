## Extracted Job Description

<think>

Okay, let's tackle this job posting extraction. The user wants the Core Responsibilities and Essential Qualifications sections converted into a structured format with specific categories under "Your Tasks" and details in "Your Profile". 

First, I need to parse each part of the responsibilities and qualifications. Let's start with the Core Responsibilities:

The first responsibility is designing and implementing climate action programs across 15+ countries. That sounds like program management and implementation. Then managing relationships—so stakeholder collaboration and project oversight? Overseeing budgets relates to financial management or compliance. Coordinating with communities touches on community engagement, which might fall under communication or stakeholder tasks. Developing grant proposals could be part of innovation or reporting if it involves creating documents. Monitoring evaluations would be data analysis or quality control. Representing at conferences is public speaking. Leading teams is about team leadership.

For Essential Qualifications: A master's degree in relevant fields—so education. 7+ years experience points to technical skills and maybe language? The track record in climate projects relates to specific responsibilities under tasks like innovation or program management. Managing budgets connects to financial oversight, which might be part of compliance or project management. Understanding climate science is a knowledge area, perhaps under technical skills. Stakeholder engagement here could align with collaboration.

Now, the categories for "Your Tasks" need 6 bullet points. The user mentioned strategic categorization into groups like Process Management, Data Analysis, etc. Let me think: Program Management, Stakeholder Collaboration, Financial Oversight, Community Engagement, Innovation/Grant Development, Monitoring & Evaluation, Public Speaking? Wait, but they said maximum 6 bullets. Let's see:

Looking at the responsibilities:
1. Design and implement programs → Program Management
2. Manage relationships → Stakeholder Collaboration
3. Oversee budgets → Financial Management or Compliance?
4. Coordinate with communities → Community Engagement/Stakeholder Interaction
5. Develop grant proposals → Innovation, Grant Development, maybe Reporting if it's about creating documents.
6. Monitor evaluations → Data Analysis/Metrics Monitoring
7. Represent at conferences → Public Speaking/Lobbying
8. Lead teams → Team Leadership

But need to fit into 6 categories. Maybe group some together. For example:
- Program Management (1,2)
- Stakeholder Collaboration (3,4?)
Wait, managing relationships and coordinating with communities could be under one category. Then Financial Oversight for budget management. Monitoring & Evaluation for the tracking part. Innovation/Grant Development if developing proposals is considered innovative or creative work. Public Speaking from representing at conferences. Team Leadership from leading teams. Maybe Compliance? But overseeing budgets might also relate to compliance in terms of financial adherence.

Alternatively, adjust categories based on action verbs used:

Looking back at each responsibility and the required action verb for tasks (develop, implement, verify, analyze, collaborate, monitor):

- Design/implement: Implement
- Manage relationships: Collaborate
- Oversee budgets: Monitor? Or Control?
- Coordinate with communities: Communicate or Engage?
- Develop proposals: Develop or Create?
- Monitor evaluations: Analyze

Public speaking is a separate action verb. Leading teams might be "coordinate" if it's about organizing, but maybe that's part of team leadership.

Hmm. Let's list the tasks first:

Core Responsibilities:
1. Design and implement climate action programs across 15+ countries → Program Management/Implementation
2. Manage relationships with government partners, NGOs, international organizations → Stakeholder Collaboration
3. Oversee project budgets (€500K to €5M) annually → Financial Oversight or Budget Management
4. Coordinate with local communities on implementation → Community Engagement/Stakeholder Interaction
5. Develop grant proposals and secure funding → Grant Development/Innovation (if creating new ideas)
6. Monitor and evaluate program effectiveness using impact measurement frameworks → Data Analysis/Metrics Monitoring
7. Represent organization at international conferences → Public Speaking/Lobbying
8. Lead cross-cultural teams of 20+ staff members → Team Leadership

Now, need to map these into 6 categories with action verbs:

Possible categories:
1. Program Management: Implement programs (responsibility 1), develop proposals (5)
2. Stakeholder Collaboration: Manage relationships (2), coordinate communities (4)
3. Financial Oversight: Oversee budgets (3)
4. Community Engagement: Coordinate with local communities (4) – but maybe under collaboration
Wait, perhaps split into:
- Program Management & Development: Implement, develop proposals
- Stakeholder Relations: Collaborate, manage relationships
- Financial Management: Oversee budgets
- Monitoring & Evaluation: Monitor evaluations
- Public Speaking/Representation: Represent at conferences
- Team Leadership: Lead cross-cultural teams

But the user said 6 bullet points maximum. So need to fit all into 6 categories. Let's see:

1. **Program Development** (Implement, develop proposals)
2. **Stakeholder Collaboration** (Manage relationships, coordinate communities)
3. **Financial Management** (Oversee budgets)
4. **Monitoring & Evaluation** (Monitor evaluations)
5. **Public Speaking/Representation**
6. **Team Leadership**

But that's 6 categories. Each with specific action verbs:

1. Program Development: Implement programs; develop grant proposals
2. Stakeholder Collaboration: Manage relationships, coordinate communities
3. Financial Management: Oversee budgets
4. Monitoring & Evaluation: Monitor and evaluate program effectiveness
5. Public Speaking/Representation: Represent organization at conferences
6. Team Leadership: Lead cross-cultural teams

Yes, that works. Each responsibility is covered under one category with the correct action verb.

Now for Essential Qualifications:

- Master's degree in relevant field → Education
- 7+ years experience → Technical Skills (experience)
- Track record in climate project implementation → Program Management or Innovation?
- Managing complex budgets → Financial Management/Technical Skill
- Understanding of climate science and renewable energy → Technical Knowledge
- Success in stakeholder engagement → Communication/Collaboration

So under "Your Profile" sections:

*Education & Experience:* Master's degree, 7+ years experience.

*Technical Skills:* Climate project implementation (maybe as a specific process), managing budgets (€500K-€5M) relates to financial management. Technical knowledge of climate science and renewable energy. GIS software? The original mentions technical skills like SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Excel but in this job posting it's more about systems mentioned elsewhere. Wait, the user provided an example where they list specific tools like SimCorp. Here, maybe no specific tech tools are listed except for grant writing experience which might relate to Microsoft Office or others. But according to extraction guidelines, under Technical Skills we need required software, etc. The job posting mentions "Proficiency in multiple languages", but that's covered elsewhere.

Wait, the user's example includes technical skills like SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Excel. Here, maybe no specific systems mentioned except for grant writing which might not be a system. But perhaps GIS is part of Technical Skills here? Since it's listed under Responsibilities: Technical knowledge of GIS software and data analysis tools. So in "Technical Skills" we can include that.

So:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's, 7+ years
- Technical Skills: Climate project implementation (track record), managing budgets (€500K-€5M), technical knowledge of climate science/renewable energy, GIS software proficiency.
Wait, but the track record in implementing projects is more about experience rather than a specific skill. Maybe under "Technical Skills" we can list systems or tools if any are mentioned. The job posting mentions grant writing (which might be Microsoft Word or similar), and data analysis tools as part of responsibilities.

But according to extraction guidelines, Technical Skills should include required software, etc., from the job posting. Here, in this case, maybe "Technical Knowledge" under Other? Or perhaps:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree (field) + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: Climate/environmental project management systems (if any), but since none are specified here except for grant writing and data analysis tools which might be part of responsibilities. Wait, the original job posting under Responsibilities mentions "experience with monitoring & evaluation frameworks" so maybe that's a process rather than software.

Alternatively, in this case, Technical Skills could include:

- Proficiency in Microsoft Office (for grant writing)
- GIS software for spatial analysis
But since it's not explicitly stated as required tools here except for the data analysis part. Hmm. Maybe under "Technical Skills", we can list climate science and renewable energy knowledge? But according to guidelines, technical skills are systems, tools, etc.

Wait, in this job posting, Technical Skills listed include proficiency in multiple languages (which is covered under Language Skills), experience with monitoring & evaluation frameworks, grant writing success (€1M+ annually). So perhaps:

Technical Skills: Monitoring & Evaluation frameworks expertise; Grant Writing; Data Analysis for climate projects. But the guidelines say to list specific systems, tools, etc. Since GIS software and data analysis tools are mentioned in responsibilities under Technical Knowledge? Or maybe here they don't specify a tool but mention "technical knowledge", which might not be listed as technical skill.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Technical Skills:
- Proficiency with Microsoft Office (for grant writing)
- Experience using monitoring & evaluation frameworks
- Data analysis for climate projects

But the original job posting under Technical Skills mentions: proficiency in multiple languages (covered elsewhere), experience with M&E frameworks, grant writing success. So maybe "Grant Writing" and "Data Analysis" could be part of technical skills here.

However, according to guidelines, it's systems, tools, software. Grant writing might not require a specific tool beyond word processors. But if the organization uses a particular system for grants, but since that's not specified, perhaps we can include under Technical Skills: Experience with grant writing and data analysis as competencies rather than technical skills. Alternatively, maybe "Technical Knowledge" is part of Other.

Wait, in the user's example (V16 Hybrid Template), under Your Profile there's:

*Technical Skills:* SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Excel

So here, they list specific tools. In this job posting, there are no such systems mentioned except for grant writing which might be using general software. But maybe "technical knowledge of climate science and renewable energy" is considered a technical skill? Or perhaps it's part of Technical Knowledge under Other.

But according to the guidelines, Technical Skills should include required systems, tools, etc. So if there's none specified here beyond data analysis in responsibilities, then:

Technical Skills: Experience with monitoring & evaluation frameworks; grant writing experience (€1M+ annually secured); GIS software and data analysis tools (from Responsibilities). Wait, but those are mentioned under the Core Responsibilities' Technical Knowledge? Or do they belong to technical skills?

Hmm. The original job posting's "Skills & Competencies" section lists:

- Proficiency in multiple languages
- Experience with monitoring & evaluation frameworks
- Grant writing experience...
- Technical knowledge of GIS software and data analysis tools

So, perhaps under Technical Skills we can include: Monitoring & Evaluation (as a framework), grant writing as part of technical skill if it's process-based. But the guidelines say to list specific systems or tools. Since no specific system is mentioned here except for climate science/renewable energy knowledge which might not be a tool.

Alternatively, maybe "Technical Knowledge" isn't listed under Technical Skills but in Other? The user's example includes other qualifications like certifications (PMP preferred). So perhaps:

*Your Profile*
- Technical Skills: Monitoring & Evaluation frameworks expertise; grant writing experience (€1M+ secured); data analysis for climate projects
But the guidelines say to list systems, tools. Since GIS and data analysis are mentioned in responsibilities under technical knowledge, maybe they belong there? Or do we need to include them here?

Wait, no. The user's example lists Technical Skills as SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Excel. So if a job posting mentions "technical knowledge of GIS software", that would be part of Technical Skills even though it's not a specific system. But in this case, the original post doesn't mention any systems except for grant writing which might use Word or similar.

Alternatively, maybe under Other we can include technical skills like data analysis and climate science expertise. Wait, but according to guidelines:

*Your Profile*
- Technical Skills: Required systems, tools...
So if there's no specific system mentioned here beyond the knowledge of GIS software (but that's in responsibilities), perhaps this job posting doesn't require listing any particular tool under Technical Skills. Then maybe we can omit that part or put it under Other?

But according to extraction guidelines for "Technical Skills", it's required systems, tools, etc. Since none are specified besides grant writing which is a process skill rather than a system/tool.

So in the profile:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree (field) + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: Monitoring & Evaluation frameworks expertise; grant writing success (€1M+ secured annually)
But that's not systems or tools. Maybe this section is incomplete here, but according to guidelines, we need to list required software if any are mentioned. Since none are specified in the job posting except for data analysis and GIS which were part of responsibilities.

Therefore, under Technical Skills, perhaps only include what's explicitly stated as technical: grant writing (if considered a skill) or leave it out? But no, according to guidelines, we need to list required systems, tools mentioned. Since none are here beyond languages and M&E frameworks expertise.

So maybe:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's in Environmental Science/International Development + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: Monitoring & Evaluation (LogFrame, Theory of Change) framework usage; grant writing with €1M+ secured annually
But that's more about skills than tools. Hmm. Maybe this job posting doesn't have specific technical systems listed here except for the data analysis and GIS in responsibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps under Other we can include "Technical Knowledge: Familiarity with climate science and renewable energy technologies". But according to guidelines, Technical Skills are separate from other qualifications like languages or soft skills.

Wait, looking back at the user's example (V16 Hybrid Template):

Under Your Profile:
- Education & Experience
- Technical Skills: SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Excel
- Language Skills...
- Other...

So in this case, if a job posting mentions "technical knowledge of GIS software and data analysis tools", but doesn't specify which ones, how to handle it? Maybe we can list them as general technical skills. Alternatively, since they are mentioned under the Responsibilities section's Technical Knowledge, perhaps not here.

Given that, maybe for this specific job posting:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree in Environmental Science/International Development + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: Data analysis and climate project implementation expertise; grant writing success (€1M+ secured annually)
But the guidelines say to list required systems or tools. Since none are specified here, perhaps this part is omitted? But no, according to extraction guidelines, if it's mentioned in any section (like Responsibilities), but under Your Profile's Technical Skills.

Wait, the original job posting lists "Technical knowledge of GIS software and data analysis tools" under Skills & Competencies. So maybe that should be included under Technical Skills here as well. Even though they are not specific systems like SAP or Excel. Because it's technical knowledge required for the role.

So in this case:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree (field) + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: GIS software proficiency; data analysis tools expertise

But since the original job posting doesn't specify which ones, maybe just "GIS and Data Analysis Tools" as a category. But according to guidelines, it's better to be specific if possible. Since no specifics are given here except for climate science/renewable energy knowledge in Essential Qualifications.

Wait, but under Technical Skills in your example includes systems like SimCorp Dimension. Here, the job posting mentions "technical knowledge of GIS software and data analysis tools" which would fall under technical skills even without specifying names. So we can include that as a general category.

So:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree (field) + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: Data Analysis; GIS Software Proficiency

But the job posting mentions both, so maybe combine them into one bullet point? But according to guidelines, each required system/tool should be listed. Since there are two here but no specifics, perhaps list as "Data analysis and spatial analysis tools".

Alternatively, split:

- Technical Skills: Data Analysis; GIS Software
But since they mentioned both in the same sentence.

Hmm. Maybe it's better to include under Other if there's not enough info. But according to guidelines, technical skills should be specific systems or tools required. Since this job posting mentions them but doesn't specify names, perhaps we can list "Data analysis and spatial analysis (GIS) proficiency" as a Technical Skill even without the exact software name.

Alternatively, since they are mentioned in the Skills & Competencies section under Technical Knowledge, maybe it's better to include here if possible. But according to extraction guidelines, only required systems/ tools should be listed. Since GIS is part of technical knowledge but not necessarily a system unless specified. So perhaps:

*Your Profile*
- Technical Skills: Data Analysis; Grant Writing

But the original job posting mentions grant writing as experience (which might require Word or similar), and data analysis in responsibilities under Technical Knowledge.

This is getting complicated. Let's proceed with what's clear from the Essential Qualifications section, which includes "technical knowledge of climate science and renewable energy technologies". That would fall under Other: Technical Skills? Or maybe not, since it's more about domain expertise than a tool.

Wait, according to guidelines:

*Your Profile*
- Technical Skills: Required systems, tools...

So if there's no specific system mentioned here except for grant writing (which is process-based), then perhaps this section doesn't have any technical skills listed. But the job posting does mention "technical knowledge of GIS software and data analysis tools" under Competencies. So maybe we can include that in Technical Skills as a general category.

Thus:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree (field) + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: Data Analysis; GIS Software Proficiency

But the original mentions both, so combine them into one bullet point? But guidelines say to list each required system/tool. Since they are separate here but no specifics given, perhaps split:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree (field) + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills:
  - Data Analysis and Spatial Analysis Tools Proficiency
  - Grant Writing with €1M+ Secured Annually

But the guidelines say to keep each bullet concise. So maybe list them as separate bullets but within a single line.

Alternatively, given that both are mentioned in one sentence in the job posting, combine under Technical Skills:

- **Technical Skills:** Data Analysis and Spatial/Climate Technology Proficiency; Grant Writing with €1M+ Secured Annually

But this is getting too long. The guidelines say 15-20 words per bullet. So perhaps list them as two separate bullets but within one line.

Now, moving to Other: Essential soft skills, personal attributes, additional qualifications.

From the job posting:

- Strong understanding of climate science and renewable energy technologies (Technical Knowledge)
- Demonstrated success in stakeholder engagement and partnership building

So under Other:

*Your Profile*
- **Other:** Technical Expertise: Climate Science & Renewable Energy; Stakeholder Engagement Success
But need to fit into concise bullets. Maybe:

- **Other:** Technical Expertise - Climate Science, Renewable Energy Technologies; Proven Stakeholder Partnership Building

Alternatively:

- **Other:** Technical Skills in Environmental Policy and Finance (budget management); Effective Communication Across Cultures

Wait, the job posting mentions "Managing complex budgets" which relates to financial skills but that's covered under Financial Management. So maybe not.

The essential soft skills would include things like leadership, communication, adaptability, etc., plus any additional qualifications mentioned.

In this case:

- **Other:** Technical Expertise: Climate Science & Renewable Energy; Proven Stakeholder Engagement and Partnership Building

But the job posting's Essential Qualifications mention "Proven track record in climate/environmental project implementation" which is more about experience than technical skill. So perhaps under Other, we can include that as a qualification.

Alternatively:

- **Other:** Technical Knowledge: Climate Science & Renewable Energy Technologies; Stakeholder Engagement Success

Yes, this seems better. It covers both the technical knowledge and stakeholder success mentioned in Essential Qualifications.

Putting it all together:

**Your Tasks Section Categories:**

1. Program Development
2. Stakeholder Collaboration
3. Financial Management
4. Monitoring & Evaluation
5. Public Speaking/Representation
6. Team Leadership

Each with specific action verbs from responsibilities.

**Your Profile Sections:**

- Education & Experience: Master's + 7+ years.
- Technical Skills: Data Analysis, GIS Software (if applicable), but as per the job posting mentions "technical knowledge" here without specifics, maybe omit and include in Other?
Wait, no. The user's example includes technical skills like SimCorp Dimension etc., so if this job post mentions specific tools or systems, they should be listed under Technical Skills. Since it doesn't specify any system names beyond climate science/renewable energy which is covered under Other.

Therefore:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience: Master's degree (field) + 7+ years experience
- Technical Skills: Data Analysis; Grant Writing with €1M+ Secured Annually
- Language Skills: English required, German/French/Spanish valued levels?
Wait, the job posting under Skills mentions "Proficiency in multiple languages" which is covered under Language Skills. So:

*Your Profile*
- Education & Experience...
- Technical Skills...
- **Language Skills:** Fluent English; Intermediate French/German/Spanish
- Other: Technical Expertise - Climate Science and Renewable Energy Technologies; Proven Stakeholder Engagement Success

But the guidelines say to list required languages with proficiency levels. The job posting says "Fluent German and English", but in this case, it's "Proficiency in multiple languages (English required)". So:

**Language Skills:** Fluent English; Intermediate French/Spanish/German

Wait, original example lists "Fluent German and English" so for this one, since it mentions "multiple languages with English required", perhaps list as:

- **Language Skills:** Fluent English; Proficient in French/Spanish (levels not specified)

But the guidelines say to include proficiency levels if mentioned. Since it's stated as "Proficiency in multiple languages (English required)", we can write:

- **Language Skills:** Fluent English; Intermediate French, Spanish

Assuming intermediate for others.

Putting it all together now.
