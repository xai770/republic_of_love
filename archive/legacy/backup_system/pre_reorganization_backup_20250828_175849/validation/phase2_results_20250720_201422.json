They want a structured job description in \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile\" format. The example given uses bullet points under each category, so I need to follow that structure.\n\nLooking at the job posting, the main title is \"Business Analyst (E-invoicing)\" at DWS. The tasks section should focus on the responsibilities. The job description mentions several key areas: E-invoicing process setup, invoice verification, checking invoice information, monitoring fees, analyzing discrepancies, data delivery, collaboration with stakeholders, evaluating contracts, process improvement, and implementing strategies. I need to categorize these into logical groups. For example, \"E-Invoicing Process Management\" could cover the setup and implementation. \"Invoice Verification & Compliance\" would include checking information and legal compliance. \"Stakeholder Collaboration\" would cover working with internal and external parties. \"Process Improvement & Optimization\" might include process improvement and strategy implementation. \"Data Management & Reporting\" could handle data delivery and reporting. Also, there's project work mentioned, so maybe a category for that.\n\nFor the \"Your Profile\" section, the requirements include education (economics degree or equivalent), experience in asset management operations, accounting knowledge, preferred skills in specific systems like SimCorp, SAP, Excel, language proficiency (German and English, French a plus), and soft skills like communication and teamwork. I should organize these into categories like Education & Experience, Technical Skills, Language Skills, Soft Skills, etc. Also, the job mentions preferred qualifications, so I need to note those as such.\n\nI need to ensure that each bullet point is specific and uses action verbs. For example, \"Develop and implement E-invoicing processes\" instead of just \"Handle E-invoicing.\" Also, check for any specific systems or tools mentioned, like SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Excel, and include those in the technical skills section.\n\nWait, the job posting also mentions \"Key Operating Documents (KOD), Service Level Agreements (SLA's), Key Performance Indicators (KPI's), Key Risk Indicators (KRI's)\" which should be part of the responsibilities under \"Process Management & Compliance.\" Also, the collaboration with stakeholders includes internal and external parties, so that's part of the Stakeholder Collaboration category.\n\nLet me list out all the tasks first. The job description lists several tasks:\n\n1. E-invoicing process setup and implementation\n2. Invoice verification process centralization\n3. Checking invoice info for accuracy and legal compliance\n4. Monitoring fee transactions, ensuring timely payments\n5. Analyzing and resolving discrepancies (cash breaks)\n6. Data delivery to finance and reporting\n7. Collaboration with stakeholders (contracts, finance, etc.)\n8. Evaluating new contracts and system configurations\n9. Process improvement and strategy implementation\n10. Documentation, standardization, and improvement of methods\n11. Implementing business strategies under compliance\n12. Project work\n\nNow, grouping these into categories. The example categories include Process Development & Implementation, Data Management & Verification, Stakeholder Collaboration, Quality Assurance & Compliance, Reporting & Documentation, Process Improvement & Optimization, Project Management, System Administration. So maybe:\n\n- E-Invoicing Process Management\n- Invoice Verification & Compliance\n- Stakeholder Collaboration\n- Data Management & Reporting\n- Process Improvement & Optimization\n- Project Management\n\nFor the profile, the education is economics or equivalent. Experience in asset management operations, accounting in funds or finance. Technical skills include SimCorp, SAP, Excel. Languages: German (fluent), English (fluent), French (preferred). Soft skills: communication, teamwork, initiative, problem-solving. Also, preferred qualifications like product/system knowledge and customer interaction experience.\n\nI need to make sure each category in \"Your Tasks\" has 5-8 points. Let me check the example in the guidelines. The example has 8 tasks. The job posting has more than that, so I need to group them appropriately. For instance, the tasks related to process setup, verification, collaboration, data, process improvement, and project management. Maybe split into 6 categories with 2-3 points each. Let me structure that.\n\nNow, for the profile, the education is a required part. Technical skills include the systems mentioned. Language skills are German and English, with French as a plus. Soft skills include communication, teamwork, initiative. Also, the job mentions \"fundierte Kenntnisse in MS Office-Anwendungen (insbesondere Excel)\" which is part of technical skills. The experience in operations and accounting is under Education & Experience. The preferred qualifications are listed as \"Von Vorteil\" which are additional points under Technical Skills or Soft Skills.\n\nI need to ensure that the output follows the required format exactly, with the sections and bullet points. Also, check for any specific terms like \"Key Operating Documents\" which should be included in the responsibilities. Alright, time to structure all this into the required format.\n...done thinking.\n\n```\n## Business Analyst (E-invoicing) - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **E-Invoicing Process Management**: Develop and implement E-invoicing processes, including BAU (Business As Usual) implementation and invoice processing workflows  \n* **Invoice Verification & Compliance**: Validate invoice information for accuracy, ensure compliance with legal frameworks, and verify adherence to contractual obligations  \n* **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Coordinate with internal teams (Finance, Contracts, Custodians) and external partners (vendors, auditors) to align processes and resolve issues  \n* **Data Management & Reporting**: Deliver accurate financial data to stakeholders, prepare reports, and maintain transparency in invoice tracking and reconciliation  \n* **Process Improvement & Optimization**: Identify inefficiencies in invoice workflows, design automation solutions, and standardize procedures to enhance operational efficiency  \n* **Risk Management & Compliance**: Monitor fee transactions for timely payment, analyze discrepancies (cash breaks), and mitigate financial risks through proactive audits  \n* **Strategic Implementation**: Execute business strategies under compliance with KOD (Key Operating Documents), SLAs (Service Level Agreements), KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), and KRI (Key Risk Indicators)  \n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience**: Bachelor’s degree in Economics, Business Administration, or related field; 3+ years in asset management operations or financial accounting with focus on fund operations  \n* **Technical Skills**: Proficiency in SimCorp Dimension, SAP, and Microsoft Excel; familiarity with financial systems and regulatory frameworks (e.g., MiFID II)  \n* **Language Proficiency**: Fluent in German and English; intermediate French is an advantage  \n* **Soft Skills**: Strong analytical mindset, excellent communication skills, and ability to collaborate cross-functionally; proactive problem-solving and decision-making  \n* **Preferred Qualifications**: Experience in financial services or fund accounting; knowledge of corporate governance and compliance standards; customer-centric approach with proven stakeholder management skills  \n```\n\n",

They want a structured job description in a specific format with \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile\" sections. The example given uses bullet points with categories, so I need to follow that structure closely.\n\nLooking at the job posting provided, it's in German, so I'll need to parse through the text to identify the key responsibilities and requirements. The job title is \"Lead Engineer (d/m/w) – Bare Metal as-a-Service (BMaaS)\". I'll start by extracting the main responsibilities from the \"Ihre Aufgaben\" section. \n\nThe tasks mention developing solutions for BMaaS and VMaaS, working with cross-functional teams, analyzing existing integrations, ensuring user-friendliness and API access, integrating with cloud platforms, using tools like Terraform and Ansible, and DevOps automation. I should categorize these into logical groups like Solution Development, Cross-Functional Collaboration, Integration Analysis, Cloud Integration, Automation & DevOps, etc.\n\nFor the \"Your Profile\" section, the requirements include a degree in computer science, experience with Python, YAML/HCL, Git/Github, knowledge of Bare Metal concepts, network virtualization, Terraform, hyperscalers like GCP, and server virtualization. I'll need to organize these under Education & Experience, Technical Skills, and maybe Soft Skills if applicable. Also, note any preferred qualifications like experience with VMware.\n\nI need to ensure that each category is specific and uses action verbs. For example, under Technical Skills, list the specific tools and systems mentioned. Also, check for any language requirements, but in this case, it seems the primary language is German, but the job might require English proficiency since it's a global role. Wait, the original job posting is in German but mentions international teams, so maybe English is required. However, the user didn't specify, so I should check if there's any mention of language skills. The job posting does mention \"gutes Verständnis\" which is German, but since it's a global team, perhaps English is also required. However, the user hasn't specified, so maybe just include German proficiency if mentioned.\n\nWait, the job title is in German, but the position is in Frankfurt, and the company is Deutsche Bank, which is a global company. So it's likely that English is a required language. However, the original text doesn't explicitly state that. The user's guidelines mention including language requirements with proficiency levels, so I should check if there's any mention. The job posting says \"gutes Verständnis\" which is German, but maybe the candidate is expected to speak English. Since it's not explicitly stated, maybe I shouldn't assume. Alternatively, since the job is for a global team, English proficiency might be implied. However, the user's example categories include Language Skills, so I need to include that if applicable. If the job posting doesn't mention it, I should omit it unless it's implied.\n\nLooking back, the job posting doesn't mention language skills beyond German. So maybe the Language Skills section isn't needed here. But the user's example includes it, so perhaps I should check again. The job posting says \"gutes Verständnis\" which is German, but since the role is global, maybe English is required. However, the user's guidelines say to include language requirements if mentioned. Since the job posting doesn't explicitly state English proficiency, I might not include it unless it's implied. But to be safe, maybe include German proficiency as required and English as preferred. However, the user's example categories include Language Skills, so I should include it if applicable. Since the job is in Frankfurt and the company is German, but the team is global, it's safer to assume English is required. But since the original text doesn't specify, I need to be cautious. Maybe the user expects that, but I have to go strictly by the provided text. Since the job posting doesn't mention language skills beyond German, I'll omit that section unless there's a mention. Alternatively, maybe the user expects that the candidate needs to speak English, but the original text doesn't state it. So I'll proceed without Language Skills unless there's a mention. \n\nNow, structuring the \"Your Tasks\" with categories. The main tasks are developing BMaaS/VMaaS solutions, collaborating with cross-functional teams, analyzing integrations, ensuring API access, integrating with cloud platforms, using Terraform and Ansible, and DevOps automation.

      "output": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this job description extraction. First, I need to understand the user's request. They want a structured job description in two main sections: \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile,\" following specific guidelines. The example provided uses bullet points under each category, so I need to mirror that format.\n\nLooking at the job posting, the key responsibilities are listed under \"Your key responsibilities.\" The user mentioned organizing tasks into categories like Process Development & Implementation, Data Management, etc. Let me see which categories fit here. The main tasks involve designing network infrastructure, selecting products, collaborating with stakeholders, testing, presenting designs, and training. So categories like Network Infrastructure Design, Product Selection & Evaluation, Stakeholder Collaboration, Testing & Evaluation, Training & Documentation, and Compliance & Standards might work.\n\nFor the \"Your Profile\" section, the requirements include education, experience, technical skills, certifications, and language. The job mentions a degree in specific fields, 10 years of experience, TOGAF certification, knowledge of certain vendors/products, and IT audit certifications. I should categorize these under Education & Experience, Technical Skills & Systems, Certifications, and maybe Language Skills if mentioned. The job doesn't specify languages, so maybe that section can be omitted unless there's a mention. \n\nWait, the job posting is in German and English, but there's no mention of language proficiency, so maybe the Language Skills section isn't needed here. I'll check again. The original job posting doesn't mention language requirements beyond the job being in English, but the user's example includes Language Skills. Since the job is in English, maybe it's implied, but the user's guidelines say to include if specified. Since the job doesn't explicitly state language proficiency levels, perhaps I can skip that section or note it as optional.\n\nNow, compiling the \"Your Tasks\" section. The main responsibilities are designing network architecture, selecting products, collaborating with stakeholders, testing, presenting designs, and training. Each of these can be grouped into categories. For example:\n\n- Network Infrastructure Design & Standards Development\n- Product Selection & Evaluation\n- Stakeholder Collaboration & Requirements Gathering\n- Testing & Evaluation\n- Training & Documentation\n- Compliance & Standards Implementation\n\nEach bullet point needs to be concise and use action verbs. For example, \"Design and develop global network infrastructure standards\" for the first category.\n\nFor \"Your Profile,\" the education is a degree in specific fields. Experience is 10+ years in network security. Technical skills include knowledge of Cisco/Arista, Checkpoint/Fortinet, Cisco ISE, VMware NSX. Certifications like TOGAF, IT audit, and industry certifications. Also, the proven track record in designing solutions with POC testing, documentation, etc.\n\nI need to ensure that all required sections are covered and that the structure is clear. Also, check for any missed details, like the part about the job being available full-time or part-time, but that's more about the job type, not the responsibilities or profile. The user's example doesn't include job type in the structured output, so I can omit that.\n\nLet me make sure each bullet in \"Your Tasks\" is under a logical category and uses action verbs. Similarly, \"Your Profile\" should list all required qualifications, including certifications and experience levels. Also, note that the job prefers certain certifications like TOGAF and IT audit, so those should be mentioned as preferred.\n\nFinally, review the example categories provided by the user to ensure alignment. For instance, \"Process Development & Implementation\" might be similar to \"Network Infrastructure Design & Standards Development.\" \"Technical Skills & Systems\" would cover the vendor products and certifications.\n\nI think that's all. Time to structure the response accordingly.\n...done thinking.\n\n```\n## Senior Network Engineer (f/m/x) - Zero Trust Networks - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Network Infrastructure Design & Standards Development**: Design and develop global network infrastructure standards, including Zero Trust architecture, to align with Deutsche Bank’s security and operational requirements  \n* **Product Selection & Evaluation**: Identify and select network security products (e.g., Cisco/Arista, Checkpoint/Fortinet, Cisco ISE, VMware NSX) that meet organizational needs through rigorous testing and evaluation  \n* **Stakeholder Collaboration & Requirements Gathering**: Engage with key stakeholders to collect requirements, define solutions, and ensure alignment with business and technical objectives  \n* **Testing & Evaluation**: Conduct product testing, proof-of-concept (PoC) development, and high-level design (HLD)/low-level design (LLD) documentation for large-scale network solutions  \n* **Training & Documentation**: Deliver technical training to teams on network architectures, security solutions, and implementation processes, ensuring knowledge transfer and operational readiness  \n* **Compliance & Standards Implementation**: Ensure adherence to security frameworks, audit requirements, and industry standards (e.g., IT audit protocols) during solution design and deployment  \n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience**: Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Computer Engineering, Business Information Science, or a related field; at least 10 years of professional experience in network security and infrastructure design  \n* **Technical Skills & Systems**: Expertise in designing and implementing Zero Trust networks; proficiency with Cisco/Arista routing/switching, Checkpoint/Fortinet firewalls, Cisco ISE, and VMware NSX; experience with network security architectures and protocols  \n* **Certifications**: TOGAF certification preferred; IT audit certifications (e.g., CISA, CISSP) strongly preferred; industry-recognized certifications in IT security (e.g., CISSP, CISM) are a plus  \n* **Proven Track Record**: Demonstrated success in delivering large-scale network solutions, including 3rd-level operational support, product handover, and documentation of complex technical designs  \n* **Soft Skills & Competencies**: Strong analytical and problem-solving abilities; ability to collaborate across global teams; leadership in agile environments; attention to detail and commitment to technical excellence  \n```\n\n",

The main tasks are around tax reporting, compliance, working with cross-functional teams, and process improvements. The profile section includes educational requirements, experience, technical skills, language proficiency, and soft skills.\n\nStarting with \"Your Tasks,\" I need to categorize the responsibilities. The job posting mentions tasks like calculating taxes under HGB and IFRS, collaborating with teams, handling tax reporting and compliance, monitoring tax positions, and driving automation. I should group these into logical categories. Maybe \"Tax Reporting & Compliance,\" \"Cross-Functional Collaboration,\" \"Process Automation & Optimization,\" and \"Documentation & Compliance Monitoring.\"\n\nFor \"Your Profile,\" the education is a business or comparable degree with a focus on taxes or a Diplom-Finanzwirt. Experience includes multiple years in tax reporting for large corporations or tax consulting. Technical skills would be IFRS/HGB knowledge, SAP, MS Office (especially Excel), and familiarity with GlobalTaxCenter and TaxBalance. Language skills are German and English at a high level. Soft skills include teamwork, responsibility, and problem-solving. Also, mention the part-time/full-time flexibility.\n\nWait, the user's guidelines specify to include both required and preferred qualifications. The job posting mentions \"ideal\" knowledge of banking-specific tax areas, which might be a preferred qualification. Also, the part-time option is a requirement. Need to make sure all these points are covered.\n\nI should check if I missed any categories. The example includes \"Industry Knowledge\" and \"Certifications,\" but the job posting doesn't mention certifications. Maybe that's not needed here. Also, ensure that each bullet is concise and specific. Avoid vague statements. For example, instead of just \"collaborate with teams,\" specify cross-functional and international teams.\n\nDouble-check the technical skills: SAP, MS Office (Excel), GlobalTaxCenter, TaxBalance. Also, the required languages are German and English, both at very good levels. The profile should list these with proficiency levels.\n\nMake sure the structure matches the example, with clear headings and bullet points.

      "output": "Thinking...\nOkay, let me tackle this query. The user provided a detailed job description for an Information Security Specialist at Deutsche Bank, and they want me to structure the response into two main sections: Key Responsibilities and Skills & Experience. \n\nFirst, I need to parse through the job description to extract the key responsibilities. The user mentioned that the responsibilities are listed under \"Your Key Responsibilities\" in both English and German. I should look for bullet points or sections that outline the tasks the candidate is expected to perform. For example, conducting risk assessments, reviewing policies, providing documentation, coordinating reviews, etc.\n\nNext, the Skills and Experience section is under \"Your Skills and Experience\" in both languages. Here, I need to list the required qualifications, such as experience in IT security, knowledge of specific frameworks like ISO27001, proficiency in languages (English and German), understanding of financial regulations, and familiarity with GRC tools. Also, there are some plus points like experience with Shared Assessment Programs and data reporting.\n\nI should make sure to present each section clearly, using bullet points for readability. It's important to maintain the original language points but perhaps translate them if necessary, though the user provided both English and German versions. Wait, the user might want the response in English, as the initial query is in English. Let me check the original query again. The user wrote the query in English, so the response should be in English, but the job description includes German text. However, the user's instruction is to structure the response, so maybe they just want the key points extracted without translation. \n\nWait, looking back, the user's instruction says: \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" But the actual task is to structure the job description into the two sections. The user might be expecting the information to be organized, not translated. So I should extract the key points from both the English and German sections, but present them in English. \n\nWait, the user's original query includes both English and German text, but the answer should be in English. So I need to extract the information from both languages and present it in English. For example, the German part mentions \"Fluently communicate in English and German,\" which is already in English. The rest of the German sections need to be translated or summarized in English. \n\nWait, no. The user might have included the German text as part of the job description, and the task is to structure the information into the two sections, regardless of the language. However, the user's instruction is to present the answer in English. Therefore, I need to extract the key points from both the English and German sections and present them in English. \n\nLet me go through the job description again. The English part under \"Your Key Responsibilities\" includes conducting risk assessments, reviewing policies, business impact analysis, documentation, remediation recommendations, coordinating reviews, supporting compliance programs, providing regulatory responses, improving security frameworks, and presenting risks. The German part under \"Your Skills and Experience\" includes overall experience in IT security, knowledge of controls and risk management, fluency in English and German, understanding of the financial industry, experience with ISO27001 and other frameworks, understanding of GRC tools, proficiency in MS Office, and experience with Shared Assessment Programs and data reporting as plus points. \n\nI need to compile all these points into two sections: Key Responsibilities and Skills & Experience, making sure to include both the English and German points but present them in English. For example, the German part mentions \"Fluently communicate in English and German,\" which is already in English. The rest of the German content needs to be translated or summarized. \n\nWait, maybe the user just wants the information from the English part, and the German is just additional. But the user included both, so I should make sure to include all relevant points. However, since the user's query is in English, perhaps they just want the English version of the job description structured. Let me check the original job description again. \n\nThe user provided the job description in both English and German. The answer should be structured in English, so I need to extract the key responsibilities from the English part and the skills from the English part, including any mentions of German fluency. The German parts might have additional details that need to be included. For example, the German part mentions \"Fluently communicate in English and German,\" which is already covered in the English part. \n\nWait, perhaps the user wants the answer in English, so I can focus on the English sections. However, the German parts might have additional key points that need to be included. For instance, the German part under \"Your Skills and Experience\" includes \"Verständnis von Finanzvorschriften\" which translates to \"Understanding of financial regulations.\" That's already mentioned in the English part. \n\nSo, the main task is to structure the information from the English sections into the two sections. I'll list each responsibility and skill, ensuring all points are covered without redundancy. I'll also note the plus points mentioned in the German part, like experience with Shared Assessment Programs and data reporting. \n\nFinally, I need to present the answer in a clear, organized manner, using bullet points for each section. The user might be looking for a concise summary that can be used for job posting or candidate screening. Making sure that all required qualifications and responsibilities are included is crucial. \n\nI should also check for any missed points. For example, the German part mentions \"Supporting the team to improve the overall security control framework\" which is already in the English section. The \"Provide response and necessary artifacts for Regulatory queries across all regions (globally)\" is covered. \n\nAlright, I think I have all the necessary points. Now, I'll structure them into the two sections as requested.\n...done thinking.\n\n**Key Responsibilities**  \n- Conduct information security risk assessments for third parties as part of the overall third-party risk management process, including onsite visits and reviews.  \n- Review third-party policies and evidence related to information security, and assess security gap analyses against Deutsche Bank’s security requirements.  \n- Perform risk reviews and business impact analyses of identified gaps, ensuring comprehensive documentation of findings.  \n- Formulate remediation recommendations and collaborate with third parties and project managers to resolve security issues promptly, fostering stronger relationships.  \n- Support and coordinate third-party information security review processes, track third-party services, escalate issues as needed, and negotiate contractual security obligations with third parties, business units, and the legal team.  \n- Assist in compliance and risk assessment programs that support corporate-wide security initiatives, and participate in key control projects to enhance the assessment function.  \n- Provide responses and necessary artifacts for regulatory queries across all global regions.  \n- Contribute to improving the overall security control framework by introducing new controls and refining existing ones.  \n- Document and present information security risks clearly and concisely to various management levels within the bank and to third parties.  \n\n---\n\n**Skills & Experience**  \n- **Technical and Organizational Expertise**: Proven experience in IT security and information security, with knowledge of both technical and organizational controls.  \n- **Language Proficiency**: Fluency in English and German.  \n- **Industry Understanding**: Strong grasp of the banking/financial industry, including the ability to evaluate the impact of security risks on financial institutions.  \n- **Standards & Frameworks**: Experience with ISO27001, NIST, ENISA, ISO27017, SOC2, PCI, MITRE ATT&CK, Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), and CSS Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ).  \n- **Regulatory Knowledge**: Familiarity with financial regulations and guidelines impacting information security (e.g., EU Cybersecurity Act, MAS & HKMA TRM, EBA Guidelines, DORA, GDPR, NYDFS, SoX).  \n- **GRC Tools**: Understanding of Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) tools, services, frameworks, and best practices.  \n- **Technical Proficiency**: Highly proficient in MS Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) for reporting purposes.  \n- **Plus Points**:  \n  - Experience with Shared Assessment Programs (e.g., SIG, FSQS).  \n  - Experience in data reporting, including the definition of metrics and data sources.  \n\n---  \nThis structure ensures clarity and completeness, aligning with the job description's requirements.\n\n",
