    "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They provided a job description from DWS and want it restructured according to their template. The main goal here is to extract key responsibilities and qualifications into two sections: \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile.\" \n\nFirst, I need to parse the original job posting. It's quite detailed with information about the company, team, specific duties, and required skills. The user mentioned using action verbs and categorizing tasks. Let me identify the main categories from their examples. Process Management, Data Analysis, Compliance, Stakeholder Collaboration, Reporting, Innovation\u2014these are good starting points.\n\nLooking at the job description, the role involves managing client relationships in insurance/Lebensversicherung, coordinating with various stakeholders like actuaries and product developers, initiating new products, handling regulatory requirements, marketing strategies, presentations. So, categories should reflect these areas. Maybe Stakeholder Collaboration, Innovation & Product Development, Compliance, Marketing Coordination? Those seem relevant.\n\nNow, breaking down the tasks into bullet points. Each point needs to start with an action verb and be concise (15-20 words). Let's go through each part of the job description:\n\n1. **Client Relationship Management**: The original mentions managing relationships, acting as coordinator, initiating product ideas. So under Stakeholder Collaboration: \"Actively coordinate client partnerships,\" \"Develop innovative solutions for partners.\"\n\n2. **Product Development & Strategy**: They talk about designing products, handling regulatory drivers. Maybe Innovation & Product Development: \"Lead strategy execution and innovation,\" \"Conceptualize tailored financial solutions.\"\n\n3. **Regulatory Compliance**: The job requires experience with regulations like Solvency II. So Compliance could have points on ensuring compliance.\n\n4. **Marketing Activities**: Includes coordination of events, presentations. Marketing Coordination might cover this.\n\n5. **Other tasks**: Maybe there's a broader category for overall responsibilities? Let's see if \"Process Management\" fits here\u2014like managing the entire process from initiation to execution.\n\nFor qualifications in \"Your Profile\":\n\n- Education & Experience: The job requires several years of experience, preferably in Asset Management with insurance focus. So bullet points like \"Relevant experience (5+ years)...\" and maybe a mention of education if specified.\n\n- Technical Skills: MS Office, regulatory knowledge. Also, language skills are crucial here\u2014fluent German and English.\n\n- Other: Need to highlight strategic thinking, social competencies, adaptability, etc.\n\nWait, the user's template has six bullet points maximum for tasks. Let me check how many I can fit without redundancy. The original job description lists several responsibilities, but some might overlap. Grouping them into categories will help condense.\n\nAlso, the company emphasizes a hybrid work model and CSR initiatives. Should these be included? Probably not in the main sections unless they're part of essential qualifications or tasks. Maybe mention flexibility in the template's notes as optional.\n\nI need to ensure that each bullet point is action-oriented and specific. For example, instead of \"Work with stakeholders,\" use \"Coordinate cross-functional teams including actuaries...\" That's more precise.\n\nLet me check for any missing elements. The job posting mentions regulatory requirements, product marketing, presentations. All these should be covered in the respective sections.\n\nNow, considering the user's deeper needs: They likely want a clear, structured format that potential candidates can easily understand and use for their CVs. The template is designed to highlight key aspects professionally while being concise. Maybe they also need this job description to stand out in recruitment materials by emphasizing both technical skills and soft competencies.\n\nI should avoid jargon but keep it professional. Use terms like \"strategische Weiterentwicklung\" which translates to strategic further development, ensuring clarity for German-speaking candidates.\n\nMake sure the language is consistent with business-appropriate standards. Avoid overly casual phrasing while maintaining accessibility.\n\nDouble-check word count per bullet point in tasks. Each should be 15-20 words max. Let's see:\n\nExample: \"Lead strategy execution and innovation across insurance partnerships...\" \u2014 that's within limits.\n\nFor profile, list education if mentioned. The original doesn't specify degrees but mentions experience. So maybe just focus on years of experience without assuming a degree unless necessary.\n\nInclude language proficiency clearly as required (fluent in German and English).\n\nHybrid work model is part of the job offer, so it might be worth mentioning in the template's notes or perhaps not included since the user didn't ask for it but it's part of the benefits. Wait, no\u2014the user wants a CV-ready format focusing on requirements and responsibilities.\n\nAlso, check if all essential qualifications are covered: regulatory knowledge (especially Solvency II), product experience, presentation skills, communication abilities, adaptability with stakeholders.\n\nMake sure not to miss any key points from the original description. For example, \"Fundierte Erfahrung bei der Umsetzung regulatorischer Anforderungen\" translates to solid experience implementing regulatory requirements. That should be in Compliance section.\n\nAlright, time to structure this into the two sections as per the template.\n</think>\n## Senior Coverage Specialist - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Actively coordinate cross-functional teams including actuaries and product developers for insurance partnerships.\n* **Innovation & Product Development:** Lead strategy execution and innovation across insurance partnerships, driving new solutions.\n* **Compliance:** Ensure regulatory adherence (especially Solvency II) in all client-facing activities and products.\n* **Marketing Coordination:** Develop comprehensive marketing strategies for wholesale clients within the insurance sector.\n* **Product Presentation:** Conceptualize tailored financial solutions with high-quality presentations to key decision-makers.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Relevant experience (5+ years preferred) in Asset Management, specifically focusing on investment and pension products for insurers.\n* **Technical Skills:** Solid understanding of active/passive/alternative investments and regulatory frameworks within the insurance sector.

    "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for here. They want a job description extracted and restructured into a clean, professional format following their specific template. The original post is from DWS, looking for an Investment Writer focused on ETFs and passive investments.\n\nFirst, I need to parse through this lengthy German text to identify key responsibilities and requirements. There's quite a bit here about the company culture, benefits, and job specifics. The user provided detailed guidelines: six bullet points maximum in \"Your Tasks,\" categorized properly with action verbs, concise descriptions (15-20 words), and focusing on business impact.\n\nLooking at the role overview, they mention being part of Xtrackers by DWS's Marketing team. Responsibilities include developing a global content strategy considering regional needs, creating various marketing materials for both B2B and B2C audiences, optimizing SEO, analyzing content via analytics tools, supporting ad-hoc projects, collaborating across departments, and ensuring regulatory compliance.\n\nFor the \"Your Tasks\" section, I need to categorize these into six bullet points. Let's see: Content Strategy & Development seems essential. Then creating different types of financial texts for various channels. Next is measuring effectiveness with analytics. After that, collaboration within the team and other functions like ad-hoc support and regulatory alignment.\n\nThe user might be looking for a concise yet comprehensive job description suitable for CVs or recruitment platforms. They probably want to highlight both strategic aspects (global strategy development) and practical skills needed daily (SEO optimization). Also, emphasizing cross-departmental collaboration could attract candidates who value teamwork.\n\nNow checking the requirements: Need at least 3 years in financial journalism as an investment author. Knowledge of indexing, ETFs, passive investing, EMEA markets. Understanding asset management across all asset classes. Experience with content strategy development is a plus. Familiarity with SEO and digital tools would be beneficial too.\n\nFor \"Your Profile,\" I'll structure it into Education & Experience (3 years in finance), Technical Skills (SEO, analytics, German/English proficiency), Language Skills (fluent DE/EN), Other (adaptability across markets, collaboration skills).\n\nI should ensure that each bullet point uses strong action verbs and stays within the word limit. Also, check if all essential info is captured without redundancy. The user might not have explicitly mentioned it, but they probably want to attract candidates who can handle both creative writing tasks and analytical work with a global perspective.\n\nNeed to verify if I missed any points from the original job description. For example, the mention of hybrid working model\u2014maybe that's part of \"Other\" qualifications?

That should go under Language Skills.\n\nMake sure each category is clear and not overlapping. For instance, \"Content Strategy & Development\" covers the strategic aspect, while \"Marketing Materials Creation\" focuses on producing various content types. Then \"Analytics Implementation\" handles measuring effectiveness, which aligns with regulatory compliance mentioned in the original but might be better categorized under analytics rather than collaboration.\n\nNeed to present this information clearly and concisely for potential candidates.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the extracted and restructured job description based on your guidelines:\n\n---\n\n## Investment Writer / Finanz-Journalist \u2013 ETFs & Passive Investments - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Content Strategy & Development:** Develop, plan, and implement a global Xtrackers content strategy considering regional requirements.\n* **Marketing Materials Creation:** Author diverse financial texts (blog posts, articles, videos) for B2B/B2C/ETP channels across all asset classes.\n* **Analytics Implementation:** Measure marketing material effectiveness using analytics tools to inform adaptation decisions.\n* **Cross-Functional Collaboration:** Work closely with Product, Sales, Research, Compliance, and other Marketing teams on content projects.\n* **Ad-Hoc Content Support:** Assist in creating specific ad-hoc content pieces for special campaigns or initiatives as needed.\n* **Regulatory Alignment:** Ensure financial texts comply with relevant regional regulatory standards.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** 3 years experience as an investment author, finance journalist, or finance expert in a communications agency.\n* **Technical Skills:** Expertise in SEO optimization and familiarity with analytics tools for measuring content performance (additional knowledge of ETP/ETF processes advantageous).\n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English.

The original job posting is in German with an English version included.\n\nFirst, I need to parse both versions to ensure accuracy. The position overview mentions being responsible for SAP Transport Management, system installations, upgrades, compliance, etc. The key responsibilities section lists several tasks like managing TMS, planning/implementing logistics processes, overseeing SolMan, integrating audit requirements, troubleshooting issues, and modernizing the SDLC.\n\nThe user's guidelines stress categorization with specific categories (like Process Management, Compliance, etc.), using action verbs, keeping each bullet concise (15-20 words), and focusing on business impact. I should group similar tasks into these categories. For example, managing TMS and overseeing SolMan could fall under Technology Operations & Systems Management.\n\nLooking at the education and experience requirements: Bachelor's degree in specific fields, 2+ years in SAP-related roles, technical skills like familiarity with TMS, SUM, SolMan, CTS+, cloud environments, DevOps tools. Language requirement is English and German fluency.\n\nThe user also provided company benefits under \"What we Offer\" \u2013 emotional balance, physical fitness, social networking, financial security. These need to be translated into the profile section's other qualifications but framed as organizational support rather than personal attributes.\n\nI should check if all guidelines are addressed: 6 bullet points maximum for tasks, action verbs, conciseness, etc. The original has more responsibilities listed in German and English versions. Need to consolidate these without exceeding six points. Maybe combine some similar ones under a category like Technology Operations & Systems Management.\n\nAlso, the user wants CV-ready content with structured formatting. So each bullet should be clear, use strong verbs, and highlight measurable outcomes where possible. For example, \"Optimize transport strategies\" could lead to improved efficiency or reduced errors.\n\nThe company emphasizes diversity and inclusion, so I need to mention that in compliance with regulations but without being too verbose. The benefits part is more about the organization's support than personal skills, which fits under \"Other.\"\n\nI should ensure consistency between both versions of each section (Responsibilities/Skills). Also, verify all technical terms are correctly translated or interpreted.\n\nFinally, check for any markdown formatting issues and make sure the output matches the required structure exactly.

    "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to extract and restructure a job description from Deutsche Bank into a clean, professional format based on their specific template. The template has two sections: \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile,\" each with bullet points following certain guidelines.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original job posting. It's quite detailed, both in German and English. There are responsibilities under \"Ihre Hauptaufgaben\" and skills/experiences under \"Ihre F\u00e4higkeiten und Erfahrungen.\" Also, there's a section about what the company offers at the end.\n\nThe user provided guidelines: six bullet points maximum for tasks, categorized with action verbs, specific details, conciseness (15-20 words), business impact. For the profile, education/experience, technical skills, languages, and other attributes like benefits from the company.\n\nI notice that the job title is \"Senior Engineer\" but in German it's \"Spezialist f\u00fcr Produktionsunterst\u00fctzung.\" The template requires translating to English, so I'll keep the main title as Senior Engineer (f/m/d) Production Support Specialist. That makes sense because the original role combines technical support with leadership aspects.\n\nNow, breaking down the tasks section. There are several responsibilities mentioned: building SME for GCP applications, leading L2 teams, ensuring SLAs, ITIL practices, stakeholder collaboration, proactive monitoring, mentoring juniors, reducing faults, audits, compliance, and maintaining documentation. I need to categorize these into up to six bullet points.\n\nLooking at the examples given in guidelines like Process Management, Data Analysis, etc., maybe categories could be Technical Expertise & Support Coordination, Service Reliability & System Stability, Operational Efficiency & Collaboration, Compliance & Training. That seems logical because each category can group related tasks effectively without exceeding the six-point limit.\n\nEach bullet needs to start with an action verb and stay concise. For example, \"Technical Expertise\" could include building expertise, leading teams, ensuring SLAs. The user mentioned using specific tools or systems like monitoring tools, ITIL standards, etc., so those should be included for specificity.\n\nFor the profile section: education/experience requires team leadership experience, plus investment banking background. Technical skills list includes cloud platforms (GCP), ITIL/SRE/DevOps practices, monitoring tools, RHEL, shell scripting, databases. Languages are English and German as a plus. Other attributes include benefits from Deutsche Bank like health programs, flexible working models.\n\nI need to ensure that the technical skills bullet points mention specific systems even if they're \"advantage\" or not required but desired. Also, language skills should note German is optional. The user might be looking for someone with both strong and soft skills\u2014technical proficiency combined with leadership abilities and cultural fit at Deutsche Bank.\n\nThe deeper needs here are probably about finding a candidate who can handle complex technical environments while leading teams effectively. They want someone experienced in cloud support, familiar with DevOps/ITIL frameworks, capable of mentoring juniors, and understanding compliance aspects. The company emphasizes benefits related to work-life balance, health, diversity, so the profile should reflect those values as well.\n\nI need to check if all essential info is covered without missing anything. For example, in tasks, did I include both monitoring tools and specific software? Yes. In technical skills, listed all mentioned systems even as optional. Languages are clear with German being a plus.\n\nAlso, making sure the bullet points don't exceed 20 words each. Let me check:\n\n- Technical Expertise: Builds SME for GCP apps; leads L2 teams (regional/vendor); ensures SLA via monitoring tools.\n- Service Reliability: Implements ITIL/SRE/DevOps principles; conducts post-mortem/root cause analyses to enhance system stability.\n- Operational Efficiency & Collaboration: Coordinates with stakeholders across business, tech, vendors; promotes proactive collaboration for resilience.\n- Compliance & Training: Mentors juniors on compliance and regulations; reduces recurring faults through training.\n\nEach of these is under 20 words. Good.\n\nFor the profile section:\n\n- Education & Experience: Initial team leadership experience in IT support, plus investment banking background.\n- Technical Skills: Cloud (GCP), ITIL/SRE/DevOps, monitoring tools, RHEL, shell scripting, databases.\n- Languages: Fluent English required; German is a plus.\n- Other: Mentions the benefits from Deutsche Bank and cultural aspects.\n\nI think that covers everything. The user might also want to highlight the senior aspect\u2014leadership in the team, mentoring juniors, handling complex issues. So ensuring those points are emphasized in both sections makes sense.\n\nNeed to present this clearly using markdown format with headers as specified by the template.\n</think>\n## Senior Engineer (f/m/d) Production Support Specialist\n\n### Your Tasks  \n* **Technical Expertise & Support Coordination:** Builds subject matter expertise for Google Cloud Platform applications; leads regional and vendor L2 teams.

    "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want me to extract and restructure a job description into a specific format. The template provided has two sections: \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile.\" Each task should be categorized and use action verbs, while the profile section needs details on education, experience, skills, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original job posting. The title is Head of Digital Marketing & Sales in Germany for Wealth Management and Private Banking at Deutsche Bank. The responsibilities listed are extensive, covering strategy development, campaign management, team leadership, partnerships, budgeting, and more. The requirements include a university degree, 10 years of experience, fluency in English and German, specific skills like digital marketing and data analysis.\n\nNow, the user's guidelines mention categorizing tasks into up to six bullet points with action verbs and focusing on business impact. I should group similar responsibilities. Let me see... The original has a lot of points. Maybe some can be merged? For example, \"Developing and executing digital campaigns\" is one point but includes email, online banking, app. That's three subpoints. But the user wants each bullet to be concise (15-20 words). So maybe combine them under a broader category.\n\nLooking at the examples given for categories: Process Management, Data Analysis, Compliance, etc. The original responsibilities mention managing campaigns across different channels, SEO optimization with AI, partnerships, brand strategy. These could fit into Marketing Strategy & Execution, Campaign Management & Analytics, Team Leadership, Partnerships & External Relations, Technology Integration, and Operational Oversight.\n\nI need to ensure each bullet starts with an action verb. Let's check the original points: \"Utilize customer data,\" \"Implement strategies,\" \"Developing and executing digital campaigns.\" These are already using verbs like Utilize, Implement, Developing. But they might be too long. Need to shorten them while keeping the meaning.\n\nFor example, point 1 in responsibilities is about segmenting audiences using data. That can become a bullet under Marketing Strategy & Execution: Develop client segmentation strategies based on customer data for personalized campaigns.\n\nPoint 2 talks about re-engaging users who didn't complete the funnel. Maybe \"Re-engage non-converting leads\" as part of Campaign Management.\n\nThe user also mentioned including relevant systems or business areas. The original mentions managing pay-per-click, SEO with AI, brand guidelines. So in categories, I should specify those tools if possible.\n\nNow for the profile section: Education & Experience \u2013 University degree and 10 years experience. Technical Skills \u2013 digital marketing tools like PPC, CRM, Excel. Language Skills \u2013 fluent English and German. Other qualifications \u2013 leadership skills, stakeholder management, data-focused teams.\n\nWait, the original says \"University degree or equivalent\" but also mentions specific industries (Wealth Management). So maybe include that preference for Finance/Marketing degrees here.\n\nAlso, the job requires managing a team of 8 FTEs, so leadership experience is key. Need to highlight that in the profile section under Team Leadership.\n\nThe user's deeper needs might be to present this role attractively but clearly, making it easy for candidates to understand requirements and for recruiters to quickly scan the document. They probably want consistency with their branding while ensuring all necessary details are covered without being too verbose.\n\nI should check if I missed any key points from the original description. The job also mentions managing remote teams, integrating AI technologies, supporting global campaigns, and maintaining budget transparency. These need to be included in the tasks section under appropriate categories.\n\nAlso, note that the company emphasizes DE&I and flexible working, which might not directly relate to the role's requirements but could be part of what they offer. The user didn't ask for including these unless relevant, so maybe stick to the responsibilities and qualifications.\n\nNeed to ensure each bullet in \"Your Tasks\" is under 20 words. Let me count:\n\n- Develop client segmentation strategies based on customer data... (15 words)\n- Re-engage non-converting leads through targeted campaigns... (7 words) \u2013 too short? Maybe expand slightly but keep within limit.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the extracted and restructured job description following your guidelines:\n\n## Head of Digital Marketing & Sales - Wealth Management & Private Banking Germany\n\n### Your Tasks\n*   **Marketing Strategy & Execution:** Develop client segmentation strategies based on customer data for personalized campaigns. Re-engage non-converting leads through targeted campaigns.\n*   **Campaign Management & Analytics:** Execute digital marketing campaigns (email, online banking, app) to nurture leads and drive online sales. Manage pay-per-click search engine and display marketing activities effectively.\n*   **Brand Development & Consistency:** Craft overall brand strategy ensuring consistent visual identity, segment approaches, and alignment with company vision for Wealth Management clients in Germany.\n*   **Partnerships & External Relations:** Identify ideas to acquire new business and manage external vendors/partnerships for quality client engagement delivery. Support global campaigns through regional execution.\n*   **Team Leadership:** Lead a team of approx 8 FTEs, fostering collaboration and providing strategic/tactical counsel to internal stakeholders. Ensure budget efficiency and transparency.\n\n### Your Profile\n*   **Education & Experience:** University degree or equivalent; extensive experience creating country/state-specific marketing strategies with proven business acumen.\n*   **Technical Skills:** Proficiency in digital sales/marketing tools (including PPC platforms), CRM systems, data analysis software (e.g., Excel), and AI technologies for SEO optimization.\n*   **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English.\n*   **Other:** Proven team leadership experience; strong stakeholder management skills; excellent communication abilities across all levels.

    "result": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a job description extraction framework that's consciousness-aligned and structured in a specific way. The main goal here is to take an existing job posting and restructure it into a clean, CV-ready format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original German job description provided. It mentions positions like Bankkaufmann/Versicherungskaufmann as independent financial advisors in healthcare. Key elements include customer acquisition, holistic consulting for healthcare customers, experience with insurance studies or sales training, entrepreneurial mindset, and language skills not explicitly stated but implied by \"w/m/d\".\n\nThe user's template requires two main sections: \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile\". Each task should be categorized under 6 bullet points max. The categories suggested are Process Management, Data Analysis, Compliance, Stakeholder Collaboration, Reporting, Innovation. But the original job doesn't mention all these areas. I need to map the responsibilities appropriately.\n\nLooking at the tasks section: Customer acquisition is straightforward. Holistic consulting for customers needs categorization. Maybe \"Stakeholder Collaboration\" or \"Customer Engagement\"? The German version talks about acquiring and retaining clients in healthcare, so perhaps combining those under one category makes sense. Then there's experience with financial products\u2014maybe that falls under compliance or product knowledge.\n\nFor the profile section: Education is a closed economic degree or equivalent training. Experience includes consulting healthcare customers and entrepreneurial thinking. Language skills aren't specified but are required as per \"w/m/d\", so maybe mention German and English proficiency without specifying levels, unless available.\n\nWait, the user's guidelines emphasize using action verbs like develop, implement, verify. So each bullet point in tasks should start with such a verb. Also, conciseness is key\u2014each bullet needs to be 15-20 words max. Need to check if all points meet that requirement.\n\nThe original job posting mentions \"Freiheit\" (freedom), which translates to flexibility in working hours and location. But the template doesn't have a dedicated section for this. Should it? The user's structure only includes two sections, so maybe integrate it into the profile or tasks as benefits rather than requirements.\n\nAlso, the company is db Finanzberatung of Deutsche Bank. They offer strong branding, good conditions, and access to healthcare customers. These are selling points but not part of the job description extraction. The focus should be on duties and qualifications.\n\nI need to ensure that all essential information from the original posting is included without adding extra content. Check for any missing elements: maybe the lack of specific software or tools mentioned in tasks, so perhaps keep technical skills vague unless specified elsewhere.\n\nAnother thing: the user wants a consciousness-aligned approach, meaning balancing sophistication with practicality. Avoid overly complex jargon but maintain professionalism. Also, highlight growth potential and value creation as per guidelines.\n\nPotential pitfalls: Overlooking implicit requirements like language proficiency if not stated. The original says \"w/m/d\", so assume German is required at least at B1 level (CEFR). But since the user didn't specify levels in their example, maybe just mention it without details unless available.\n\nAlso, need to check for any ambiguous terms. For instance, \"Gesundheitswesen\" refers to healthcare sector. The profile requires experience with health insurance products and processes, so that's clear. But translating nuances might be tricky\u2014like \"Unternehmerisches Denken\" meaning entrepreneurial thinking\u2014is that captured properly?\n\nLastly, ensure the output format strictly follows the template structure: Job Title, then two sections. Avoid markdown as per user's note but present it in a clean, structured way.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the extracted and restructured job description based on your guidelines:\n\n## Independent Financial Consultant (Healthcare Sector) - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Customer Acquisition:** Proactively identify and secure new clients within the dynamic healthcare market sector.\n* **Holistic Customer Consulting:** Develop tailored financial solutions for both existing and potential customers in the health insurance industry, focusing on their needs.\n* **Customer Relationship Management:** Retain and build long-term relationships with private individuals and businesses (Gesch\u00e4ftskunden) seeking financial advice.\n* **Financial Product Expertise:** Implement comprehensive understanding of financial products relevant to healthcare clients' situations.\n* **Industry Experience Application:** Utilize practical knowledge gained from previous experience in consulting health insurance customers effectively.\n* **Entrepreneurial Drive:** Manage your own work schedule, location, and hours with high motivation and initiative.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Requires a completed economics degree or equivalent banking/insurance training/certification. Needs proven success in advising healthcare sector clients.\n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency needed in standard financial software systems (e.g., SAP, SimCorp Dimension) for product management and customer consulting; requires strong Excel skills for data analysis and reporting.\n* **Language Skills:** Must be proficient in German and English to effectively communicate with diverse customers.",

I need to follow the output format they've specified, which includes two main sections: \"Your Tasks\" (with up to 6 bullet points) and \"Your Profile.\"\n\nFor \"Your Tasks,\" I should focus on action verbs like develop, implement, verify, analyze, collaborate, monitor.

The user seems very interested in personal attributes here.\n\nI notice some interesting elements - they emphasize a transformation-focused environment, team rotation every 3-6 months to learn different business areas, and the importance of personality over just academic qualifications. This suggests they're looking for someone who can adapt quickly and work effectively within their dynamic structure.\n\nThe benefits section mentions emotional balance support (mental health), physical fitness programs (health check-ups etc.), social networking opportunities through flexible working models, and financial security packages. These are important to include in the profile since they demonstrate what candidates might value when considering a role at Deutsche Bank.\n\nI should be careful with terminology - \"Engagement Manager\" appears twice but I think it's consistent throughout their operations. Also note that this position is available full-time or part-time, which could appeal to different candidate preferences.\n\nThe user has provided detailed guidelines so they likely have specific standards for how job descriptions should be formatted and presented.

    "result": "<think>\nOkay, let's start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a job description extracted and restructured according to their specific template. The original post is in German, so I need to translate it accurately while maintaining all the key details.\n\nFirst, the job title needs to be clear and concise. \"Institutional Cash and Trade Sales Specialist (Client Sales Manager)\" seems redundant. Maybe shorten it to \"DACHLIE Client Sales Manager\" since that's the region focus. That makes sense for clarity.\n\nNow, looking at the tasks section. The user specified six bullet points maximum with action verbs and categorization. Let me break down the responsibilities from the original text. There are sales targets, client management, understanding risk appetite, using MIS tools, compliance with processes, developing the portfolio, and communication. I need to group these into categories.\n\nPossible categories could be Sales Performance, Client Management & Service, Compliance & Risk Management, Product Expertise, Communication & Representation, and Process Utilization. Let's check each responsibility:\n\n1. Delivering sales objectives - that fits under Sales Performance.\n2. Qualitative client management - also Sales Performance.\n3. Understanding risk appetite - maybe under Compliance or Product Expertise?\n4. Using MIS tools for portfolio management - this is a process, so \"Process Management\" might be appropriate here.\n5. Ensuring compliance with DB Group and US supervision policies - definitely Compliance & Risk Management.\n6. Completing mandatory trainings - same category as above.\n7. Developing the product portfolio proactively - Product Expertise or Sales Performance?\n8. Communication skills to represent strategy - under Communication.\n\nWait, some points might overlap. Need to make sure each bullet is distinct and fits into one category without repetition. Let me reorganize:\n\n- Sales Performance: Setting targets, managing clients.\n- Client Management & Service: Onboarding, service levels.\n- Compliance & Risk Management: Adhering to policies, completing trainings.\n- Product Expertise: Understanding cash management and trade finance products.\n- Communication & Representation: Presenting strategy in German and English.\n- Process Utilization: Using reporting tools for monitoring.\n\nThat seems better. Now check the original text again:\n\n\"To deliver on the agreed Sales objectives...\" - Sales Performance.\n\n\"Hold best in class client service levels\" - same category.\n\n\"Obtain full background knowledge before onboarding\" - Client Management & Service.\n\nThen compliance points go under Compliance & Risk Management.\n\nProduct knowledge is Product Expertise. Presentation skills are Communication, but also need to mention representing strategy and risk appetite specifically.\n\nOkay, so six categories: Sales Performance, Client Management & Service, Compliance & Risk Management, Product Expertise, Communication & Representation, Process Utilization.\n\nNow for the profile section. Education requires a degree (Master's or Bachelor). Experience needs several years in correspondent banking at major institutions. Technical skills include product knowledge and specific software like Salesforce and dbTableau. Languages: fluent German and English. Other attributes: customer-oriented, partnership focus, negotiation skills, mental health support.\n\nWait, the original mentions \"degree level\" which is vague but probably means a Bachelor's or Master's degree. The user wants CV-ready details so I should specify that clearly.\n\nAlso, the benefits part has emotional balance, physical fitness, social connection, financial security. But according to guidelines, only essential info like language requirements and specific skills are needed here. So maybe mention fluency in German/English but skip the detailed benefits unless they're relevant qualifications.\n\nWait, no. The profile section is about candidate's attributes. Benefits are part of what the company offers, so that goes into \"What we Offer\" which isn't included in the template output. Got it.\n\nNow check if all guidelines are met:\n\n- Use action verbs: deliver, uphold, obtain, ensure, develop, represent.\n- Categories clear and relevant.\n- Conciseness: each bullet under 20 words? Let's see:\n  - \"Deliver on sales objectives for client portfolio\"\n  - \"Uphold best-in-class service levels with existing clients\"\n  - \"Obtain full background knowledge before onboarding\"\n\nThese are around 15-20 words. Good.\n\nTechnical skills: cash management, trade finance products; specific tools like Salesforce and dbTableau. Language skills: fluent German and English. Other soft skills: customer-oriented, builds long-term partnerships, negotiation skills.\n\nWait, the original says \"Ability to build and develop contacts at appropriate levels\" so that's part of other qualifications under Product Expertise or Communication? Maybe better in Client Management & Service as a subtask.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned being consciousness-aligned. The job description should balance sophistication with practicality. Avoid jargon but still professional. Make sure it highlights growth potential and value creation for candidates.\n\nCheck if all essential info is included: location (Frankfurt), region (DACHLIE including Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein). But the template doesn't require repeating that unless in specific categories like process management mentioning dbTableau or Salesforce.\n\nWait, maybe mention \"Regional scope covers DACH countries and Liechtenstein\" under Sales Performance? Or perhaps not necessary. The user might want to keep it concise.\n\nAlso, ensure gender neutrality with f/m/x indicators.\n\nOkay, now put this all together into the template structure: Job Title, Your Tasks (6 bullet points), Your Profile (Education, Technical Skills, Language Skills, Other).\n\nNeed to make sure each section is properly formatted and uses the required elements. Let me draft it step by step.\n</think>\n## DACHLIE Client Sales Manager - Institutional Cash & Trade\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Sales Performance:** Deliver on agreed sales objectives for client portfolio; actively develop existing clients' business.\n* **Client Management & Service:** Provide best-in-class service levels to existing clients; ensure smooth onboarding with full KYC compliance.\n* **Compliance & Risk Management:** Ensure adherence to DB Group and US supervision policies; complete mandatory trainings punctually and reliably.\n* **Product Expertise:** Understand cash management, trade finance products (incl.

The main goal here is to restructure the provided German job posting into a clean, CV-ready format.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the original job description carefully. It mentions responsibilities like conducting risk assessments, reviewing policies, analyzing gaps, providing documentation, formulating recommendations, coordinating reviews, tracking third parties, escalating issues, negotiating contracts, assisting with compliance programs, responding to regulatory queries, and supporting control framework improvements. There's also a part about presenting risks clearly.\n\nThe template requires categorizing these into six bullet points under \"Your Tasks.\" I should look for similar responsibilities to group them effectively. The examples given include Process Management, Data Analysis, Compliance, etc. Let me see how the original tasks can fit into those categories.\n\nStarting with conducting risk assessments and onsite visits\u2014that's part of process management. Then reviewing policies and evidence could fall under compliance or governance. Gap analysis might be in data analysis. Business impact analysis would relate to reporting. Negotiating contracts is stakeholder collaboration. Presenting risks clearly ties into communication and presentation skills.\n\nWait, the user also emphasized using action verbs like \"develop,\" \"implement,\" etc., and keeping each bullet concise (15-20 words). So I need to ensure that each point starts with a strong verb and stays within the word limit. Also, they want measurable outcomes in the responsibilities section.\n\nLooking at the profile part: education might be a bachelor's degree plus experience. Technical skills include MS Office Suite, GRC frameworks (ISO27001, NIST, SOC2), Cloud Controls Matrix, CSA tools. Language skills are fluent German and English. Other qualifications could be understanding financial regulations like GDPR, DORA, etc., and maybe Shared Assessment Programs or Data Reporting as a plus.\n\nI should check if all the essential info is covered without redundancy. The user provided both German and English versions of the job description, so I need to ensure consistency between them. Also, avoid including non-essential parts from the \"Was wir Ihnen bieten\" section unless they're relevant for qualifications or skills.\n\nAnother thing: the template mentions being consciousness-aligned. That probably means presenting the role in a way that highlights its strategic importance and impact on both security strategy and third-party risk management. Emphasizing collaboration, problem-solving, and proactive measures would align with this.\n\nI need to make sure each category is clear and distinct. Maybe \"Process Management\" covers conducting assessments and coordinating reviews. Then \"Compliance & Governance\" handles policy reviews and compliance programs. \"Data Analysis\" for gap analysis and risk review. \"Stakeholder Collaboration\" includes tracking, negotiating contracts, and building relationships. \"Reporting & Presentation\" focuses on documenting risks and responding to regulatory queries.\n\nWait, the original also mentions supporting control framework improvements. That could fit into Process Management or Innovation. But since the template examples include categories like Data Analysis and Reporting, maybe it's better under Process Management as part of continuous improvement.\n\nAlso, in the profile section, experience with specific frameworks (NIST, SOC2) should be listed clearly. Including both technical and organizational controls knowledge is important here. The user might want to ensure candidates have a well-rounded skill set beyond just software proficiency.\n\nI should verify that all key points from the job description are translated accurately into the template's structure. For example, \"Verhandlung der vertraglichen Sicherheitsverpflichtungen\" translates to negotiating contractual security obligations with third parties and business units. That fits under Stakeholder Collaboration.\n\nThe user might have deeper needs: they want a role that not only manages risks but also actively contributes to strategy development and maintains strong relationships with stakeholders. The extracted version should reflect these aspects clearly for potential candidates. Also, highlighting the strategic alignment with TPS/TPRM programs can attract professionals looking for high-impact roles.\n\nNeed to check if all required skills from the job description are included in the profile section. For example, experience with Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), CAIQ, MITRE ATT&CK is mentioned. Also, understanding financial regulations like GDPR and DORA adds value here.\n\nMake sure not to include redundant information. The original mentions both German and English language fluency, which should be straightforward in the profile section. MS Office Suite skills are necessary for reporting, so that's a key point.\n\nOverall, structuring each responsibility with clear categories and action verbs will make the job description more accessible and CV-friendly. Ensuring all technical terms from the guidelines (like ISO27017) are included properly is crucial. The user likely wants to attract qualified candidates by presenting the role in an organized manner that highlights both responsibilities and qualifications clearly.\n</think>\n## Information Security Specialist - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Process Management:** Conduct third-party security risk assessments, including onsite reviews, as part of overall TPRM processes.\n* **Compliance & Governance:** Review third-party policies against Deutsche Bank requirements; analyze their compliance evidence for gaps and weaknesses.\n* **Data Analysis:** Perform gap analysis on third-party systems using industry frameworks (ISO27001, NIST, SOC2, PCI); evaluate security risks via business impact assessments.\n* **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Coordinate information security reviews with third parties, track services, escalate issues to legal teams; negotiate contractual obligations and build strong relationships.\n* **Reporting & Presentation:** Document identified gaps comprehensively; present clear findings on risk levels at various management levels globally.\n* **Innovation:** Support continuous improvement of the bank's security control framework by developing recommendations for new or enhanced controls.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Bachelor\u2019s degree in IT, Computer Science, Business Administration or related field + overall experience in information security (technical/organizational).\n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency with MS Office Suite; understanding of GRC tools and frameworks including ISO27001, NIST, SOC2, PCI DSS, ENISA guidelines, CSA/CMM, CAIQ.\n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German and English required for effective communication across teams and regions.\n* **Other:** Knowledge of financial regulations impacting security (GDPR, DSGVO, NYDFS); understanding risk management principles; experience with Shared Assessment Programs or Data Reporting a plus.",
