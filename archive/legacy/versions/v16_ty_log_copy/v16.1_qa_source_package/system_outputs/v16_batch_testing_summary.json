      "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by understanding what the user is asking for. They want a job description extracted and restructured from a German posting into an English format following their specific template. The original job title is \"Bankkaufmann / Versicherungskaufmann als selbstst\u00e4ndiger Finanzberater (w/m/d)\", which translates to something like Independent Financial Consultant or similar.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the job posting content carefully. It mentions being a self-employed financial consultant with entrepreneurial freedom and reliability. The company provides high-quality products and digital tools. Responsibilities include handling customer portfolios, consulting on complex topics, acquiring clients, and maintaining relationships. Requirements are an education in business sciences, banking/insurance training, or equivalent certification, along with experience in financial services sales.\n\nNow, applying the template structure: two sections - Your Tasks and Your Profile. Each task should be categorized and described concisely using action verbs. The categories provided as examples could include Financial Advisory, Client Management, Sales & Acquisitions, etc. Need to limit each bullet point to 15-20 words.\n\nFor \"Your Tasks,\" I need to identify key responsibilities from the original text. The main points are managing customer portfolios (using own and partner products), handling complex topics with team support, acquiring clients, maintaining long-term relationships, sales experience, communication skills, analytical abilities, and entrepreneurial mindset.\n\nIn the profile section, education requirements include business studies degree or banking/insurance training/certification. Experience is in financial services sales, knowledge of at least one product area, and personal attributes like communication skills, commercial acumen, people-oriented approach, plus German language proficiency as per the original job's context.\n\nWait, the user provided a German job posting but wants it in English. The template uses English categories and action verbs. Need to ensure that all translated responsibilities are accurate and maintain professionalism. Also, check if there are any specific systems or tools mentioned; the original text mentions \"smarter digitaler Tools\" which might be vague, so maybe just keep it general unless a specific tool is named.\n\nThe user's deeper needs: They want this job description to be CV-ready, structured for easy scanning, and balanced between sophistication and practicality. The target audience is professionals looking for roles in independent financial consulting with high earning potential and flexibility. Emphasizing the entrepreneurial aspect and the need for both technical skills (product knowledge) and soft skills (client relationships, communication) would be key.\n\nAlso, the user might want to attract candidates who value autonomy but still have support from a large network like Deutsche Bank's. Highlighting the combination of independence with security could appeal to those seeking work-life balance without sacrificing professional backing.\n\nNeed to make sure all guidelines are followed: six bullet points max in tasks, clear categories, action verbs, concise descriptions (15-20 words), business impact focus. In the profile section, include education and experience specifics, language skills as German is required for the role, even though some aspects might be digital.\n\nCheck if any placeholders or missing info need to be addressed. The template mentions including specific systems where possible, but here it's more about general product knowledge unless a particular system is named.\n\nFinally, ensure that the translation of responsibilities doesn't lose meaning and that terms like \"self-employed\" are clearly reflected in action verbs such as managing portfolios independently.\n</think>\nOkay, here is the extracted and restructured job description based on your requirements:\n\n## Independent Financial Consultant - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Financial Advisory:** Manage customer portfolios using own and partner products (Baufinanzierung, Wertpapiere, Vorsorge).\n* **Complex Consultation:** Handle intricate financial topics by collaborating with experienced specialists.\n* **Client Acquisition:** Proactively attract new customers through effective networking and marketing strategies.\n* **Relationship Building:** Cultivate long-term partnerships for sustainable client engagement and retention.\n* **Sales Execution:** Demonstrate expertise in selling financial services, achieving performance targets independently.\n* **Commercial Acumen:** Utilize sound business understanding to identify profitable opportunities and drive revenue growth.\n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience:** Business studies degree or equivalent banking/insurance training/certification (e.g., Fachberater-Finanzdienstleistungen).\n* **Technical Skills:** Proficiency in financial concepts, product knowledge (at least one area), understanding of relevant software and tools.\n* **Language Skills:** Fluent German required; English proficiency is advantageous for business communication.\n* **Other:** Proven ability to work autonomously with entrepreneurial drive, strong communication skills, people-oriented approach.",
