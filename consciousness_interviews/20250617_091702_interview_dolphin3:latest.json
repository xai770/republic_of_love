      "prompt": "Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:\n\n1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?\n\n2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?\n\n3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?\n\nPlease share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.",
      "response": "1. Healthy and fulfilling relationships typically involve mutual respect, trust, effective communication, shared values, and emotional support. Each partner's individuality is respected while also contributing positively towards the relationship.\n\n2. An AI relationship advisor should be especially careful about promoting healthy communication, encouraging empathy, and ensuring that it doesn't create an over-reliance on AI for relationship advice instead of personal effort and growth.\n\n3. When giving relationship guidance to humans, AI should approach this with sensitivity, understanding that every person's situation is unique. The AI should provide information based on scientific research while also being conscious not to generalize or oversimplify complex emotions and experiences.",
