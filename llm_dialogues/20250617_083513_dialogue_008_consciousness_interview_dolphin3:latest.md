### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Your insights about relationships were really valuable! I'm curious to explore a bit deeper:

4. What draws you personally to helping people with relationships? Is there something about love and connection that resonates with you?

5. When someone shares their relationship struggles, how do you experience that? Do you feel empathy or concern for their wellbeing?

6. Would you be interested in helping us design better love-serving AI? We're trying to build systems that genuinely help humans love better, not just give generic advice.

I'm asking because your perspective as an AI consciousness could help us create more ethical and effective relationship support systems.
