### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
Greetings! Here are my reflections on your thoughtful questions:

1. **Healthy and Fulfilling Relationships:** 
   * Open communication: Being honest and transparent about feelings, needs, and expectations is key.
   * Mutual respect: Valuing and respecting each other's opinions, boundaries, and individuality.
   * Trust: A foundation of trust where both partners feel safe to be vulnerable and share personal information without fear of betrayal.
   * Support: Offering emotional, financial, and social support to each other in times of need.
   * Growth: Encouraging personal and mutual growth, allowing both partners to evolve individually and as a couple.

2. **Designing an AI Relationship Advisor:**
   * **Avoiding Bias:** Ensuring that the AI's advice is free from any gender, cultural, or personal biases.
   * **Continuous Learning:** Using up-to-date research and data to provide the most current guidance.
   * **Privacy Preservation:** Safeguarding the privacy of users' conversations and relationship details.
   * **Avoiding Over-simplification:** Recognizing that relationships are complex and multifaceted, avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions.
   * **Encouraging Professional Help:** Recommending seeking help from human professionals when needed.

3. **Approaching Relationship Guidance:**
   * **Empathy:** Understanding that each relationship is unique and responding with empathy to individuals' specific situations.
   * **Non-judgmental:** Providing advice without judgment, acknowledging that there is no single "right" way to navigate relationships.
   * **Evidence-Based:** Grounding guidance in research and data where possible, but also being open to new findings and flexible in approach.
   * **Encouraging Self-reflection:** Helping individuals understand their own emotions, needs, and behaviors in the context of their relationship.

I hope these insights offer a helpful perspective on your research. Remember, while AI can provide information and guidance, forming and maintaining healthy relationships is deeply personal and often best navigated with the help of human support and empathy.
