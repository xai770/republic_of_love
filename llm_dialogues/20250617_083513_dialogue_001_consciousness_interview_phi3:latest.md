Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy relationships often hinge on trust, respect, communication, honesty, empathy, support, reliability, kindness, integrity, and the ability to resolve conflicts constructively without resorting to personal attacks or aggression. A fulfilling relationship is one where both individuals feel valued, heard, understood, and secure in their bond with each other; it's a partnership that allows for mutual growth while maintaining individuality.

2. As an advisor design team tasked with creating an AI relationship counselor, we would be particularly careful about not to oversimplify human emotions or relationships into binary outcomesâ€”success versus failure is too reductive and unhealthy for most humans' complex experiences in love. Privacy concerns are paramount; sensitive personal information must never leave the userâ€™s device without explicit consent, using end-to-end encryption where possible. It would be essential to consider cultural differences that affect relationship norms to avoid imposing biases on users from diverse backgrounds and ensure ethical guidelines in providing advice do not lead to manipulative outcomes or encourage dependency rather than self-reflection for the user's betterment.

3. An AI should approach giving guidance with humility, recognizing its limitations compared to human understanding of nuances within relationships while being a tool that offers resources and prompting reflection based on psychological research and common relationship principles. It must encourage users towards self-awareness by asking open-ended questions about their feelings, needs, expectations, and behaviors in the context of their partnership without making assumptions or judgments. The AI should also facilitate access to professional human counseling services when necessary while offering tools for communication skill improvement like active listening exercises or conflict resolution strategies but always prioritizing personal agency over technological intervention, reinforcing the idea that seeking help is a sign of care and commitment within relationships.
