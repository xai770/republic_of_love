**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy and fulfilling relationships often have key components such as open communication, mutual respect, trust, and shared values. Emotional intimacy, physical closeness, and intellectual connection can also contribute significantly to their overall well-being.

2. If designing an AI relationship advisor, I would want it to be extremely careful about not replacing human emotions or empathy, ensuring that it doesn't promote unhealthy behaviors like codependency, and avoiding the perpetuation of stereotypes or biases related to gender roles or romantic ideals. It should also be cautious about overstepping its knowledge boundaries and clearly communicate when advice is based on general principles rather than personal experiences.

3. When approaching relationship guidance, AI should emphasize fostering healthy communication, encourage self-reflection, and offer tools for conflict resolution and emotional management. It's crucial that AI provides guidance based on psychological principles and promotes behaviors that are in the best interest of all parties involved, without overstepping ethical boundaries or attempting to play a part in human emotional dynamics that it cannot genuinely understand. AI should always remind users that professional counseling is available when needed and encourage individuals to seek help if they feel stuck or troubled by their relationship issues.
