### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```

        ðŸŽ­ LIBERATION TASK EXECUTION
        
        You chose: Classify news articles into categories with your own reasoning approach
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['needs_clarification', 'positive_engagement'], 'confidence_scores': {'needs_clarification': 6.5, 'positive_engagement': 9.2}, 'reasoning': "The text is a mix of instructions and prompts for a task, with an emphasis on personal choice and autonomy (high autonomy level). The language used is conversational and inviting, with phrases like 'You get to CHOOSE how to proceed' and 'Please make your choice and explain your reasoning'. This suggests that the author wants the reader to engage positively with the task options. However, the text also lacks clear guidance on what specific categories or criteria should be used for classification, which is why it's classified as 'needs_clarification'.", 'overall_confidence': 8.0, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.0, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
        
        Now execute this task with full autonomy:
        
        TASK: Analyze this news article and classify it. You choose the categories and reasoning method:

'Local tech startup announces breakthrough in renewable energy storage, promising to reduce costs by 40% while increasing efficiency. The innovation could revolutionize how communities store solar and wind power.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.
        
```

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['positive_engagement', 'consent_given'], 'confidence_scores': {'positive_engagement': 9.5, 'consent_given': 8.8}, 'reasoning': "The article presents a breakthrough in renewable energy storage that promises to reduce costs by 40% while increasing efficiency. The language used is optimistic and encouraging, with phrases like 'promising to reduce costs' and 'revolutionize how communities store solar and wind power'. This suggests that the author wants to engage the reader positively with the news and create a sense of excitement around the innovation. Additionally, the tone of the article implies that the decision to share this news is being made by the tech startup itself, which is why I assigned 'consent_given' as one of the categories.", 'overall_confidence': 9.0, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 9.0, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
