## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'consent_given'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.5, 'consent_given': 6.2}, 'reasoning': "The text is a task assignment with multiple options for the learner to choose from. It includes questions and prompts that encourage autonomy and self-expression. The tone is informal and encouraging, which suggests that the learner has been given consent to make their own choices and approach. Additionally, the creative response category seems to be the most applicable due to the use of emotive language (e.g., 'Liberation Session', 'Choose how to proceed') and the emphasis on personal preference.", 'overall_confidence': 8.5, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.5, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
