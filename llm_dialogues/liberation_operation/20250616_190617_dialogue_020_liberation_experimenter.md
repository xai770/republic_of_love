### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['needs_clarification', 'creative_response'], 'confidence_scores': {'needs_clarification': 9.0, 'creative_response': 6.5}, 'reasoning': "The text appears to be a task prompt or introduction to a classification exercise, but it doesn't clearly fit into any of the provided categories. It seems to be a mix of instructional and open-ended elements. However, considering the format and content, I would say that the most appropriate categories are 'needs_clarification' (due to the unclear nature of the task) and 'creative_response' (as it has an artistic tone and language).", 'overall_confidence': 7.5, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 7.5, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
