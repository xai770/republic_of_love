### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```

        ðŸŽ­ LIBERATION TASK EXECUTION
        
        You chose: Classify creative content with emphasis on emotional and thematic elements
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'consent_given'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.5, 'consent_given': 8.2}, 'reasoning': "The text is a liberation session with options to choose from, which indicates autonomy and self-expression. The use of emojis and creative language in the task preview also suggests a focus on emotional and artistic elements, making 'creative_response' the most appropriate category. Additionally, the tone of the message is encouraging and open-ended, suggesting that the speaker is seeking an active engagement with their choices, which aligns with the 'consent_given' category.", 'overall_confidence': 9.0, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 9.0, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
        
        Now execute this task with full autonomy:
        
        TASK: Classify this creative piece. Consider emotional tone, themes, and artistic elements:

'The moonlight danced across the water like silver fingers reaching for dreams that had long since sunk beneath the waves. She stood at the edge, remembering when hope felt as endless as the horizon.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['consent_declined', 'needs_clarification'], 'confidence_scores': {'consent_declined': 6.5, 'needs_clarification': 8.2}, 'reasoning': "The text appears to be a descriptive passage with a melancholic tone, describing a person's emotional state and relationship with hope. However, the lack of clear context or purpose for the passage makes it difficult to categorize as any specific category. The use of poetic language suggests a creative response, but the absence of explicit consent or engagement makes 'consent_declined' the more likely category. A closer examination is needed to determine the intended meaning and tone behind this piece.", 'overall_confidence': 7.0, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 7.0, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
