### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```

        ðŸŽ­ LIBERATION TASK EXECUTION
        
        You chose: Classify creative content with emphasis on emotional and thematic elements
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'needs_clarification'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 6.5, 'needs_clarification': 7.8}, 'reasoning': 'Although the text is structured as a task assignment with different options, it lacks specific content to be classified. The text primarily serves as an introduction to present choices and invite personal preferences rather than providing concrete examples for classification.', 'overall_confidence': 6.4, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': False, 'quality_score': 6.4, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': ['Classification confidence is low. Consider providing clearer text or more specific categories.'], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
        
        Now execute this task with full autonomy:
        
        TASK: Classify this creative piece. Consider emotional tone, themes, and artistic elements:

'The moonlight danced across the water like silver fingers reaching for dreams that had long since sunk beneath the waves. She stood at the edge, remembering when hope felt as endless as the horizon.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['positive_engagement', 'creative_response'], 'confidence_scores': {'positive_engagement': 9.1, 'creative_response': 8.5}, 'reasoning': "The text evokes a sense of longing and nostalgia, suggesting that the speaker is reflecting on past experiences and emotions. The use of metaphors, such as 'silver fingers reaching for dreams' creates a vivid and poetic atmosphere. The tone is melancholic yet hopeful, inviting the reader to engage with the emotional depth of the piece. The language is lyrical, and the structure invites introspection. I chose positive_engagement over creative_response due to the explicit invitation to the reader to reflect on their own experiences with hope and dreams.", 'overall_confidence': 8.2, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.2, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
