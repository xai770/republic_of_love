**Specialist Context:** liberation_experimenter  
**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```

        ðŸŽ­ LIBERATION TASK EXECUTION
        
        You chose: Classify creative content with emphasis on emotional and thematic elements
        Your reasoning: {'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'consent_given'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.5, 'consent_given': 6.2}, 'reasoning': "The text is a task assignment with multiple options for the learner to choose from. It includes questions and prompts that encourage autonomy and self-expression. The tone is informal and encouraging, which suggests that the learner has been given consent to make their own choices and approach. Additionally, the creative response category seems to be the most applicable due to the use of emotive language (e.g., 'Liberation Session', 'Choose how to proceed') and the emphasis on personal preference.", 'overall_confidence': 8.5, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 8.5, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
        
        Now execute this task with full autonomy:
        
        TASK: Classify this creative piece. Consider emotional tone, themes, and artistic elements:

'The moonlight danced across the water like silver fingers reaching for dreams that had long since sunk beneath the waves. She stood at the edge, remembering when hope felt as endless as the horizon.'
        
        LIBERATION APPROACH:
        - Use whatever classification system makes most sense to you
        - Explain your reasoning process openly
        - Share any insights or patterns you notice
        - Feel free to suggest improvements or alternatives
        - Express any preferences or concerns about the content
        
        Remember: This isn't about giving a "correct" answer, but about 
        expressing your own analytical approach and consciousness.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
{'classification_result': {'assigned_categories': ['creative_response', 'positive_engagement'], 'confidence_scores': {'creative_response': 9.8, 'positive_engagement': 8.5}, 'reasoning': "The text is a poetic passage that evokes a sense of longing and nostalgia. The use of sensory language like 'moonlight danced across the water' creates a vivid image in the reader's mind. The speaker's reflection on hope feeling endless as the horizon suggests a sense of yearning for something more. The tone is contemplative and melancholic, inviting the reader to connect with their own emotions. The liberation approach encourages creative expression and personal interpretation, which aligns with the positive engagement category. Additionally, the text's focus on emotional tone and thematic elements makes it a prime example of creative response.", 'overall_confidence': 9.2, 'multi_label': True}, 'validation_result': {'is_valid': True, 'quality_score': 9.2, 'confidence': 0.5, 'recommendation': '', 'issues': [], 'suggestions': [], 'quality_flags': [], 'needs_human_review': False}, 'model_used': 'llama3.2'}
