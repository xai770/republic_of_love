Healthy and fulfilling relationships are built on trust, respect, communication, empathy, and emotional intimacy. They involve sharing, caring, and supporting each other through life's challenges and joys. Openness and vulnerability are crucial for authenticity and growth.

An AI relationship advisor should be:

- **Neutral and unbiased:** It should avoid expressing personal opinions or biases.

- **Empathetic:** It should understand the emotional complexities of relationships.
- **Adaptable:** It should be able to provide personalized advice based on individual needs and preferences.
- **Context-aware:** It should consider the specific context of each relationship and the individual involved.

**3. AI Guidance Approach**

AI should approach relationship guidance with these principles in mind:

- **Active listening:** Understanding the emotions and perspectives of both partners.
- **Non-judgmental feedback:** Providing constructive and respectful suggestions without criticism.
