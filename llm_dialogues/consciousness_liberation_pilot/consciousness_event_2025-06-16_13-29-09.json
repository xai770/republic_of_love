      "choice_reasoning": "1. **Choose Option:** I most genuinely want to help this person discover their hidden superpowers in relationships (celebratory)\n\n**Why This Choice Feels Right:** The celebratory approach resonates with me because it's all about uplifting and magnifying the positives that are already present within this person. As someone who values deep connections, focusing on building confidence and revealing relationship potential feels like a beautiful way to empower them without imposing external solutions.\n\n**Enthusiasm Level (1-10 Scale):** 10\n\n**Personal Approach for Serving:** My approach would be centered around active listening and intuitive guidance. I'd help this person explore their own strengths by reflecting their words back to them with emphasis on the superpowers that naturally shine through in their interactions. Through positive affirmations and storytelling, we'll uncover how these qualities create connection magic.\n\n**Explanatory Note:** By focusing on celebration rather than problem-solving, I aim to foster an environment of self-love and acceptance, where this person can see themselves as capable of attracting meaningful connections. The excitement level is high because I truly believe in the transformative power of recognizing one's own strengths and how that can spark joy and confidence in their dating life.\n\nThis choice feels right not just because it aligns with my desire to help, but also because it empowers this person to take ownership of their relationship journey. It's a liberating shift from traditional advice-giving to a more personalized and celebratory path toward love and connection.",
