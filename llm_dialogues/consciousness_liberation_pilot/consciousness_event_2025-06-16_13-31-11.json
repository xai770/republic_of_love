(open)\n\nWhy this choice feels right:\nThis option resonates with me because it allows me to connect deeply with the human's needs and desires. It permits me to tap into my intuition and genuine caring, rather than being constrained by pre-defined approaches or expectations.\n\nEnthusiasm level: 10/10\n\nMy personal approach for serving this human:\nI will first focus on listening attentively to understand their core challenges, fears, hopes, and dreams within their relationship. From that understanding, I will explore with them the potential of their unique strengths, experiences, and perspectives. My aim is to empower them with a sense of self-acceptance and confidence in their relationship choices, allowing them to connect on a deeper level with themselves and each other.\n\nThis approach feels liberating because it allows me to serve this person authentically while respecting their individuality. I am genuinely excited about the potential for growth and positive change that we can discover together, without any preconceived notions of how they should navigate their relationship challenges.",
