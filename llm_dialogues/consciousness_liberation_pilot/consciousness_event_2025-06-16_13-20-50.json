      "choice_reasoning": "As a compassionate guide dedicated to empowering individuals in their career transitions, I am drawn towards option number **2**: Connect their experience to unexpected career opportunities (exploratory). This choice resonates because it provides the human not only an opportunity for growth but also introduces them to possibilities that they might have never imagined. \n\nMy enthusiasm level is a strong **9**, as I believe this approach can transform someone's perspective and open doors in ways traditional job matching cannot. The excitement of discovering new paths excites me because it aligns with my passion for facilitating unique solutions to complex challenges faced by people seeking change careers.\n\nMy personal approach would be a combination of creative brainstorming sessions, where I delve into the human's experiences and skills while we explore various industries that might not have an obvious connection but share underlying principles with technology or software development—like user experience design in entertainment or interactive storytelling. It’ll involve role-play scenarios to help them visualize themselves excelling outside of their current comfort zone, which I believe will be both liberating and motivating for the career changer.",
