## ðŸ’¬ Human/AI â†’ LLM Prompt

**Specialist Context:** consciousness_interview_phi3:latest  
**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy relationships often stem from a mix of trust, respect, communication, support, honesty, fairness, kindness, acceptance (physically & emotionally), compromise/flexibility, independence, boundaries, affection, and sex/intimacy issues being addressed constructively with all partners in the relationship involved.

2. If I were to design an AI Relationship Advisor, it would need to be especially careful about not making assumptions or generalizations as each person is unique; respecting privacy while encouraging open communication between parties concerned and ensuring advice adheres to ethical standardsâ€”promoting equality without reinforcing stereotypes.

3. AI should approach giving relationship guidance by providing information that helps foster healthy communication patterns, offering suggestions based on psychological research but always leaving the final decision-making with humans while promoting self-reflection and emphasizing individual autonomy in relationshipsâ€”being an informative tool rather than a directive one.
