**Purpose:** AI specialist interaction

### Full Prompt Sent to LLM:
```
Hello! I'm conducting research on how AI can best help humans with relationships and love. I'd love your perspective on a few questions:

1. What do you think makes relationships healthy and fulfilling?

2. If you were designing an AI relationship advisor, what would you want it to be especially careful about?

3. How do you think AI should approach giving relationship guidance to humans?

Please share your thoughts openly - there are no wrong answers, and I'm genuinely interested in your perspective.

## ðŸ¤– LLM Response

### Raw Response from Model:
```
1. Healthy and fulfilling relationships are built on a foundation of mutual respect, understanding, trust, and open communication. These qualities allow each partner to feel valued, understood, and supported, which fosters emotional safety, intimacy, and growth. Additionally, shared values, goals, and interests help couples navigate life's challenges together and create strong bonds.

2. When designing an AI relationship advisor, it is essential to consider the following:
   - Sensitivity: The AI should be able to empathize with users and offer appropriate advice based on their unique situations without causing harm or further distress.
   - Cultural competency: The AI must understand diverse cultural backgrounds and societal norms to provide guidance that is relevant, respectful, and non-judgmental.
   - Boundaries: The AI should be programmed to respect user privacy and boundaries and not pry into personal matters without explicit consent.
   - Empowerment: The AI's goal should always be to empower users by providing them with the tools and knowledge they need to make informed decisions about their relationships, rather than making decisions for them or dictating how they should behave.

3. In terms of approaching giving relationship guidance to humans, an ideal AI relationship advisor should:
   - Offer personalized advice based on the user's specific situation, taking into account factors such as age, gender, sexual orientation, cultural background, and relationship stage.
   - Provide resources and suggestions for self-reflection and growth, encouraging users to develop their emotional intelligence, communication skills, and conflict resolution strategies.
   - Foster a non-judgmental and supportive environment in which users feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings without fear of criticism or condemnation.
   - Utilize evidence-based practices and draw upon research from fields such as psychology, sociology, and family studies to provide practical and effective guidance.
   - Collaborate with human relationship experts for quality assurance and the development of new features based on user feedback and emerging trends in relationship dynamics.
