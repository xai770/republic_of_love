a coherent and concise set of skills.\n6. **Sales & Marketing**: Consolidated some categories to keep within the limit.\n7. **Security & Compliance**: Included policy management and refined the description for clarity.\n8. **Operations & Logistics**: Adjusted the category list to ensure all relevant operations topics are included.\n\nThis structure ensures that all 103 categories are assigned without exceeding the maximum folder size of 20 items each, providing a balanced and coherent taxonomy."
