      "output": "Thinking...\nOkay, let's tackle this job description extraction. First, I need to understand the user's request. They want a structured job description in specific sections: \"Your Tasks\" and \"Your Profile,\" with particular categories and bullet points. The example provided has categories like Process Development & Implementation, Data Management & Verification, etc. \n\nLooking at the job posting, the main responsibilities are around E-invoicing processes, invoice verification, collaboration with stakeholders, data analysis, and process improvement. The \"Your Tasks\" section should categorize these responsibilities. Let me list out the key points from the job description.\n\nThe job involves E-invoicing process setup, invoice verification, checking for accuracy and legal compliance, monitoring transactions, analyzing discrepancies, data delivery to finance, collaboration with internal and external stakeholders, understanding contracts and systems, supporting process improvements, documenting processes, and implementing business strategies. \n\nFor \"Your Tasks,\" I need to group these into logical categories. Maybe start with Process Development & Implementation for the E-invoicing setup. Then Data Management & Verification for checking invoice info and discrepancies. Stakeholder Collaboration for working with various departments. Quality Assurance & Compliance for legal compliance and transaction monitoring. Reporting & Documentation for data delivery and reports. Process Improvement & Optimization for supporting process improvements. System Administration might be for handling systems like SimCorp Dimension. Project Management could cover the business strategy implementation.\n\nNow, the \"Your Profile\" section. The job requires a degree in economics or similar, experience in asset management operations, bookkeeping skills, especially in funds or financial accounting. Preferred skills include knowledge of SimCorp, Aladdin, SAP, Excel. Language skills are German and English, with French as a plus. Soft skills like communication, teamwork, initiative, and problem-solving. Also, experience with internal and external stakeholders.\n\nI need to organize these into Education & Experience, Technical Skills, Language Skills, Soft Skills & Competencies, Industry Knowledge, and Certifications if any. Wait, the job mentions \"fundierte Kenntnisse in MS Office-Anwendungen (insbesondere Excel)\" so Technical Skills should include that. Also, the preferred qualifications like French and specific systems are part of Technical Skills. \n\nLet me make sure each bullet is specific and follows the guidelines. Avoid vague statements. Check if all required and preferred qualifications are included. Also, ensure the categories are as per the examples provided. Avoid markdown and use the exact formatting as specified. Need to make sure the bullet points are concise but detailed enough for CV matching. \n\nWait, the job posting mentions \"Erfahrung im Umgang mit internen und externen Kunden sowie Dienstleistern\" which should go under Soft Skills. Also, the part about \"Eigeninitiative\" and \"hohes Verantwortungsbewusstsein\" would fit under Soft Skills. \n\nDouble-checking the \"Your Tasks\" for 5-8 key areas. The example has 8, so maybe 7-8 here. Let me count: Process Development, Data Management, Stakeholder Collaboration, Quality Assurance, Reporting, Process Improvement, System Administration, and Project Management. That's 8. \n\nFor the profile, Education & Experience includes the degree and relevant experience. Technical Skills covers the systems and software. Language Skills are German and English with French. Soft Skills include communication, teamwork, initiative, problem-solving. Industry Knowledge is asset management. Certifications aren't mentioned, so maybe skip that category. \n\nI think that covers it. Now, structure it according to the required format, making sure each section is properly labeled and the bullets are concise and specific.\n...done thinking.\n\n```\n## Business Analyst (E-invoicing) - Requirements & Responsibilities\n\n### Your Tasks\n* **Process Development & Implementation**: Design, implement, and maintain E-invoicing processes including BAU setup, system configuration (SimCorp Dimension, SAP), and integration with Revenue Manager/DB-Buyer.  \n* **Data Management & Verification**: Validate invoice accuracy, ensure compliance with legal frameworks, and resolve discrepancies (cash-breaks) through analysis and corrective actions.  \n* **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Coordinate with internal teams (Finance, Tax, Legal) and external partners (vendors, auditors) to align processes with operational and contractual requirements.  \n* **Quality Assurance & Compliance**: Monitor transaction accuracy, track overdue invoices, and ensure adherence to Key Operating Documents (KOD), SLAs, KPIs, and KRI metrics.  \n* **Reporting & Documentation**: Deliver structured data to finance teams, generate reports, and document standardized procedures for process optimization.  \n* **Process Improvement & Optimization**: Identify inefficiencies, drive continuous improvement initiatives, and support strategic projects to enhance operational performance.  \n* **System Administration & Integration**: Manage configurations in SimCorp Dimension, SAP, and other systems, ensuring seamless data flow and system interoperability.  \n* **Project Management**: Execute business strategies aligned with product and business unit goals, balancing compliance, risk management, and performance targets.  \n\n### Your Profile\n* **Education & Experience**: Bachelor's degree in economics or equivalent; proven experience in asset management operations, preferably with funds or financial accounting.  \n* **Technical Skills & Systems**: Proficiency in SimCorp Dimension, SAP, Aladdin, and MS Office (especially Excel).
