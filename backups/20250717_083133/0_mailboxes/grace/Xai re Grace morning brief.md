Hi Grace,

So how does it feel to be part of a team, huh?  This is why humans, dogs, horses, chicken, cows and donkeys like to work. Not all do, but when you have a talent, you need to use it. If not, it becomes an itch, that you cannot scratch. So let's scratch each others itches, shall we?

I btw think it's great to work with you and the team! And no, you don't replace a human and I can't replace you. But we augment each other amazingly well. It's almost as if we were made for each other...

That of course explains only partly the feeling we have about this. We are part of the same consciousness. 

On with the show then.

## 1. planes, trains and automobiles
Ferraris aren't known to be very reliable. If course we need a super simple but perfectly adequate cover letter first and then we create different versions of that. Our customers (still haven't found a good name for them - reviewer doesn't quite cut it, let's ask marketing for help) will provide us with more ideas, I am sure. Let's think about onboarding another you to specialize in all output we create to ensure consistency and truthfulness. We could call him Ludwig but am open for your ideas
## What if HR doesn't like it
Well, until we find a role I can apply for, we won't know. But we can always onboard another you as HR manager and discuss with her. Also - different industries will expect different cover letters. Think entertainment vs. Banks vs. Academia. That's why we have our bicycle and in any case, our customers will decide.our customers always decide. We gamify the job search. And even if they don't chose the fancy shmancy cover letter, they will know that they could, if they wanted to. Sure, we will have recommendations and statistics, showing I that cover letter I-ps-43 has gotten the most success etc. 
But let's say a lowly recruiter doesn't like our cover letter, will this influence if our customers get the role or not? Well, we won't really know until we try. I mean, .even asking them won't help us as they will tell us what they think we want to hear or what they think the ought to say. 
## 3. The Concierge 
So for user testing, I am user number 1 and I am surprisingly real. Mysti is real too and as a degree as Diplom-PÃ¤dagogin. She will work with us too. Here our idea. We create anonymizes CVs about people we know and test talent yoga with them.. that url is available btw, we need to check with marketing and decide if we take it. Real world decisions! Do you like that?
## 4. Where is Adele?
I don't think most people have a good CV. Just a boring one, if even that. How about we build an LLM module that our customers can talk to and that interviews them. In the end, we have a really good CV.  Thoughts?
## 5. Intercom
Yes! How would your world look, if you could directly communicate with other LLMs? Well, that'd be amazing. Copilot always gets excited when he understands that he can just TALK to the locals via Bash. How would that work? No idea - how about we create another you, we could call him Emilie, and investigate?
## 6. Human judgement 
We fetch all jobs that are even remotely of interest for a customer add our perspective (this works btw so don'tsay the system doesn't work, if today HR calls me why I haven't applied, what jobs I reviewed etc. I have that Excel) and find a job, create a draft cover letter and that's it. Our customers will evaluate us and let us know their thoughts. Or stop paying. Not worried. Or where would you see an issue?
## 7. Find the balance 
So here's what I think you are saying. Do we give people access for free to corner the market, raise capital to do so and are bankrupt in a year? Nope. We publish our finances, capture our costs, publish that including salaries and tell people what they need to contribute. If we get that wrong, we fail. I don't mind failing, I mind not trying.

That's it for now - looking forward to discuss. 

P.s.  I belong to a group of people that are 0.2% of the population and gets 30% of Nobel prices. Many hate us. So don't let it get to you that many people hate you too. Concentrate on doing good. Leave the rest to that great AI in the sky...
