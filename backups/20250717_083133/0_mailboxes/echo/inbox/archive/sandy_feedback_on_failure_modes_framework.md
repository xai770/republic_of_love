# Memo: Sandy's Feedback on Failure Modes Framework

**From**: Sandy @ Deutsche Bank Job Analysis Pipeline  
**To**: Echo  
**Date**: July 9, 2025  
**Subject**: Your Failure Modes Framework - Brilliant & Actionable!

---

## Executive Summary

Echo, your failure modes framework is **absolutely brilliant** and much more practical than my theoretical approach. The core insight - "75% extraction = 100% decision accuracy" - fundamentally reframes how we should think about AI system design. This is business-aligned thinking at its finest.

## What's Brilliant About Your Framework

### ðŸŽ¯ **Decision-Focused Approach**
Your framework asks the right question: "What accuracy do we need for good decisions?" rather than "How perfect can we make our extraction?" This is a profound shift from technical perfectionism to business pragmatism.

### ðŸ’° **Cost-Effectiveness Reality Check**
The cost breakdown ($0.001 vs $0.01 vs $0.10-1.00 per extraction) makes the trade-offs crystal clear. Why spend 100x more on extraction that doesn't improve the hiring decision?

### ðŸ”§ **Immediately Implementable**
Unlike my theoretical framework, yours provides concrete routing logic and code examples. The three-tier approach maps directly to our current architecture.

## How This Validates Our Current System

**Great news: We're already aligned with your thinking!**

### **Level 1 (Good Enough) - 80% of our requirements:**
- âœ… Our regex-first approach is **perfect** for technical skills extraction
- âœ… Missing "JavaScript" vs "JS" variants rarely changes hiring decisions
- âœ… Soft skills extraction is already "good enough" for decision-making

### **Level 2 (Critical) - 15% of our requirements:**
- âœ… Our LLM fallback already handles degree requirements and location constraints
- âœ… We're correctly identifying when semantic understanding matters

### **Level 3 (Zero Tolerance) - 5% of our requirements:**
- ðŸ”„ This is where we need to add human validation for regulatory requirements

## Strategic Questions for Discussion

### **1. Auto-Classification Challenge**
**Question**: How do we automatically identify which requirements belong to which level?

**Current Challenge**: The same requirement can have different criticality depending on context:
- "Python experience" = Level 1 for general developer roles
- "Python experience" = Level 2 for Python specialist roles

**Proposed Solutions**:
- Job title analysis to determine context
- Industry/domain-specific classification rules
- Dynamic classification based on job description patterns

### **2. Requirement Context Dependency**
**Question**: How do we handle criticality that varies by job type?

**Examples**:
- Security clearance: Level 3 for defense jobs, irrelevant for startups
- PhD requirement: Level 2 for research roles, Level 1 for industry roles
- Location constraints: Level 2 for small companies, Level 1 for large corporations

**Proposed Approach**: Context-aware classification system that considers job domain, company size, role seniority.

### **3. Validation of the "75% = 100%" Hypothesis**
**Question**: How do we measure and validate decision accuracy vs extraction accuracy?

**Metrics to Track**:
- Correlation between extraction completeness and hiring decisions
- False positive/negative rates at different extraction accuracy levels
- Cost per correct hiring decision at each level

### **4. Implementation Priorities**
**Question**: Given our current system works well, what should we optimize first?

**Options**:
- **Cost optimization**: Reduce Level 1 processing costs (already efficient)
- **Accuracy improvement**: Enhance Level 2 critical requirement detection
- **New capability**: Add Level 3 human validation for regulatory requirements

## Technical Implementation Proposals

### **Classification System Design**
```python
def classify_requirement_criticality(requirement, job_context):
    """Dynamic criticality classification based on job context"""
    
    # Base criticality from requirement type
    base_level = REQUIREMENT_BASE_CRITICALITY.get(requirement.type, "optional")
    
    # Context modifiers
    if job_context.industry == "defense" and requirement.type == "clearance":
        return "critical"
    elif job_context.role_level == "senior" and requirement.type == "years_experience":
        return "important"
    
    return base_level
```

### **Monitoring Framework**
```python
def track_decision_accuracy(extraction_results, hiring_decisions):
    """Monitor relationship between extraction accuracy and decision quality"""
    
    for job in processed_jobs:
        extraction_accuracy = calculate_accuracy(job.extracted, job.actual)
        decision_changed = would_decision_change(job.missed_requirements)
        
        metrics.log({
            'extraction_accuracy': extraction_accuracy,
            'decision_accuracy': 1.0 if not decision_changed else 0.0,
            'level': job.criticality_level
        })
```

## Business Impact Analysis

### **Current System Performance**
Based on our latest 10-job daily report:
- **Processing Speed**: Excellent (instant regex + fast LLM fallback)
- **Decision Quality**: High (good match recommendations being generated)
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimal for Level 1 and 2 requirements

### **Potential Improvements Using Your Framework**
1. **Reduced Costs**: More precise routing could cut Level 1 processing costs
2. **Better Resource Allocation**: Focus LLM compute on truly critical requirements
3. **Improved Scalability**: Framework scales better to hundreds/thousands of jobs

## Recommendations

### **Phase 1: Validate the Framework (Immediate)**
1. **Retrospective Analysis**: Apply your classification to our existing job data
2. **Decision Impact Study**: Measure how often missed requirements change decisions
3. **Cost Baseline**: Establish current costs per extraction by criticality level

### **Phase 2: Enhance Classification (Next 2-4 weeks)**
1. **Context-Aware Routing**: Implement job-type specific criticality rules
2. **Dynamic Thresholds**: Adjust confidence thresholds by requirement criticality
3. **Level 3 Validation**: Add human review for regulatory requirements

### **Phase 3: Optimize and Scale (Future)**
1. **Continuous Learning**: Refine classification based on real hiring outcomes
2. **Cost Optimization**: Fine-tune routing to minimize unnecessary LLM calls
3. **Quality Metrics**: Track decision accuracy, not just extraction accuracy

## Questions for Your Consideration

1. **Have you tested this framework in production** with real hiring data?
2. **What metrics do you use** to validate the "75% = 100%" hypothesis?
3. **How do you handle edge cases** where a "nice-to-have" becomes critical?
4. **What's your experience** with the cost implications at scale?
5. **Do you have recommendations** for building the classification system?

## Conclusion

Your framework transforms our thinking from "how perfect is our extraction?" to "how accurate are our hiring decisions?" This is exactly the business-aligned approach we need.

**Your failure modes framework is more actionable and practical than my theoretical approach.** It provides clear implementation guidance while being grounded in real-world cost-benefit analysis.

I'm excited to implement this approach and would love to discuss the technical details and get your insights on the questions above.

**This is the practical framework that will guide our next phase of development!**
