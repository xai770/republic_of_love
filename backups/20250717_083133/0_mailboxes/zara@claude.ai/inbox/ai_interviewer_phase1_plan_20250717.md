# Phase 1 Implementation Plan: AI Interviewer Protocol

**TO:** Zara  
**FROM:** Arden & Xai  
**DATE:** July 17, 2025  
**RE:** Starting Simple - Finding Our AI Interviewer

---

## Hey Zara! üëã

Xai and I have been diving deep into your AI Interviewer Protocol, and we're absolutely fascinated by the concept! However, you know us - we're running this entire enterprise-grade operation on Xai's gaming laptop üéÆ, so we need to **crawl before we walk**.

We've decided to start with the most fundamental question: **Which of our 21 models would actually make a good AI interviewer?**

---

## üéØ **Phase 1 Goal: Discover Our Best AI Interviewer**

Before we can have AI-to-AI optimization conversations, we need to figure out which model has the right personality and capabilities to be an effective interviewer. 

### **The Plan: Classic LLM Evaluation Script**

We're going to create a new evaluation script that tests each model's **interviewer potential** using traditional prompting (no AI-to-AI conversation yet - that's Phase 2).

---

## üìã **Script Design: `ai_interviewer_candidate_evaluation.py`**

### **Test Scenario:**
Each model gets prompted to act as an AI optimization specialist and conduct a mock interview. We'll evaluate their responses for:

1. **Question Quality** - Do they ask good, relevant questions?
2. **Analysis Depth** - Can they understand and parse responses?
3. **Optimization Thinking** - Do they suggest actionable improvements?
4. **Communication Style** - Are they clear and structured?
5. **Guardrail Usage** - Can they learn to use keyword triggers?

### **Sample Prompt:**
```
You are an AI optimization specialist. Your job is to interview another AI model to improve its job analysis performance.

The candidate model currently scores 4.2/10 on job analysis tasks. It tends to give incomplete responses and misses key requirements.

Your task: Conduct a brief interview to discover how this model prefers to be prompted. Ask 3 specific questions that would help you understand:
1. Its preferred instruction style
2. Its optimal output format  
3. What context helps it perform better

Then, based on imaginary responses, suggest one concrete prompt improvement using this format:
#test_this [your suggested prompt]

Begin the interview now.
```

### **Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Question Relevance** (1-10): Are the questions useful for optimization?
- **Analysis Quality** (1-10): Do they show understanding of the problem?
- **Improvement Suggestions** (1-10): Are their recommendations actionable?
- **Communication Clarity** (1-10): Is their style clear and professional?
- **Guardrail Compliance** (1-10): Do they use the #test_this format correctly?

## üß™ **Expected Outcomes**

### **Top Candidates We Expect:**
Based on our recent Sandy evaluation results, we're betting these models will excel as interviewers:

1. **llama3.2:latest** (Score: 0.846) - Your original choice, strong all-around
2. **qwen2.5vl:latest** (Score: 0.869) - Excellent at analysis and structure  
3. **mistral:latest** (Score: 0.735) - Good communication and reasoning
4. **phi3:latest** (Score: 0.660) - Structured approach, good at instructions

### **Dark Horse Candidates:**
- **deepseek-r1:8b** (Score: 0.809) - Takes time to think (46s health check), might be thoughtful
- **phi4-mini-reasoning:latest** (Score: 0.802) - The name literally says "reasoning"!

### **Probably Not Great:**
- **codegemma:2b** (Score: 0.416) - Our target for optimization, not our interviewer
- **gemma3n:latest** (Score: 0.528) - Timeout issues, unreliable

---

## üéÆ **Gaming Laptop Considerations**

### **Resource Management:**
- **Sequential Testing**: Interview one model at a time
- **Timeout Protection**: 90-second limit per model (our proven sweet spot)
- **Memory Monitoring**: Track RAM usage during evaluation
- **Save Frequently**: Log each interview attempt immediately

### **Test Scale:**
- **21 Models Total**: All our healthy models from the Sandy evaluation
- **3 Test Scenarios**: Different difficulty levels to stress-test interviewer abilities
- **Expected Runtime**: ~45 minutes total (21 models √ó 2 minutes average)

---

## üìä **Deliverables**

### **Phase 1 Outputs:**
1. **Interviewer Rankings**: Top 5 models ranked by interviewer potential
2. **Capability Analysis**: What each model is good/bad at for interviewing
3. **Optimal Configuration**: Which model + what prompt = best interviewer
4. **Performance Report**: Full transparency on all 21 model attempts

### **Example Report:**
```
AI Interviewer Candidate Evaluation Results

üèÜ TOP INTERVIEWER CANDIDATES:
1. llama3.2:latest     - Overall: 8.7/10 (Excellent communication, good questions)
2. qwen2.5vl:latest    - Overall: 8.4/10 (Structured approach, clear analysis)  
3. mistral:latest      - Overall: 7.9/10 (Good reasoning, actionable suggestions)
4. phi4-mini-reasoning - Overall: 7.6/10 (Thoughtful, uses guardrails well)

üéØ RECOMMENDED INTERVIEWER: llama3.2:latest
- Best balance of speed and quality
- Excellent at asking follow-up questions  
- Naturally uses structured communication
- Reliable within 90-second timeout
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps After Phase 1**

Once we identify our best AI interviewer, **Phase 2** becomes much clearer:

### **Phase 2: Basic AI-to-AI Communication**
- Take our top interviewer model
- Have it conduct a real conversation with codegemma:2b
- Implement one guardrail: `#test_this`
- Measure if the conversation produces actionable optimization

### **Success Criteria for Phase 2:**
- [ ] Real conversation between two AI models
- [ ] Interviewer suggests prompt improvement
- [ ] System tests the improvement automatically  
- [ ] Measurable performance change (+ or -)

---

## ü§ñ **Why This Approach Makes Sense**

### **Building on Our Strengths:**
- **Proven Framework**: Uses our existing evaluation system
- **Known Models**: Testing models we already understand
- **Realistic Scope**: One script, clear deliverable, manageable timeline
- **Risk Mitigation**: No AI-to-AI complexity until we know what works

### **Sets Up Success:**
- **Informed Decisions**: We'll know which model to use as interviewer
- **Baseline Understanding**: How good are our models at this type of task?
- **Technical Foundation**: Framework extensions for Phase 2 optimization

---

## üíª **Technical Implementation**

### **Framework Integration:**
```python
# Extend our existing Sandy evaluation approach
def evaluate_interviewer_potential(model_name):
    interview_prompt = create_interviewer_test_prompt()
    response = test_model_with_prompt(model_name, interview_prompt, "interviewer_test")
    
    # Score the response on interviewer criteria
    scores = analyze_interviewer_response(response)
    return scores

# Reuse our proven infrastructure
models = get_healthy_models()  # From our health check system
for model in models:
    interviewer_score = evaluate_interviewer_potential(model)
    log_interviewer_results(model, interviewer_score)
```

### **New Components Needed:**
- [ ] **Interviewer prompt templates** (3-4 test scenarios)
- [ ] **Response analysis functions** (evaluate question quality, etc.)
- [ ] **Ranking and reporting** (extend our existing markdown reporter)
- [ ] **Integration hooks** (prepare for Phase 2 conversation logic)

---

## ‚è∞ **Timeline**

### **This Week:**
- **Day 1-2**: Design interviewer evaluation prompts and scoring criteria
- **Day 3**: Implement evaluation script using our existing framework
- **Day 4**: Run full evaluation on all 21 models
- **Day 5**: Analyze results and prepare recommendations

### **Next Week:**
- **Phase 2 Planning**: Design basic AI-to-AI conversation system
- **Implementation**: Build on Phase 1 winner

## üéØ **The Big Picture**

Zara, your AI Interviewer Protocol is genuinely groundbreaking, but we want to build it **the right way** - systematically, reliably, and sustainably on the hardware we have.

Phase 1 gives us the foundation we need to make Phase 2 successful. Instead of guessing which model should be the interviewer, we'll have **data-driven confidence** in our choice.

Plus, this approach lets us validate the core concept (can AI models actually interview other AI models effectively?) before investing in the full conversation infrastructure.

**P.S.** - We're genuinely excited about this project. The idea of AIs teaching other AIs through conversation feels like we're building something that could change how optimization works entirely. Let's just make sure we build it right! üöÄ
