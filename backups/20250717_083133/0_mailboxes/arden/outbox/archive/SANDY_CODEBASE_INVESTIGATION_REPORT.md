# Sandy's Codebase Investigation Report
## 5D Requirements Extraction Analysis

**Date:** January 11, 2025  
**Investigator:** Arden  
**Purpose:** Map current extraction logic and identify specific gaps for Deutsche Bank job analysis  

---

## 🔍 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Current State Assessment
- **Primary Extraction System:** ContentExtractionSpecialistV33 (production-grade, skills-focused)
- **5D System Status:** Partially implemented but fragmented across multiple files
- **Critical Gap:** 5D extraction is NOT being used consistently in the daily reports
- **German Language Support:** Limited and inconsistent

### Key Finding
**The current daily reports are NOT using comprehensive 5D extraction**. Instead, they rely primarily on:
1. ContentExtractionSpecialistV33 for technical/soft/business skills only
2. Limited fallback to enhanced requirements extractors for experience/education
3. No systematic German language processing for requirements

## 📁 CODEBASE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS

### Core Extraction Components

#### 1. Primary Skills Extraction (ACTIVE)
**File:** `sandy/core/content_extraction_specialist.py`
- **Version:** 3.3 (Production Grade)
- **Focus:** Technical, Soft, Business skills only
- **Language Support:** English-focused with limited German
- **Strengths:** Ultra-focused, conservative extraction for 90%+ accuracy
- **Limitations:** NOT a true 5D system - missing Experience & Education

```python
# Current extraction dimensions (3D, not 5D):
technical_skills = extract_technical_skills(job_description)
soft_skills = extract_soft_skills(job_description) 
business_skills = extract_business_skills(job_description)
# Missing: experience_requirements, education_requirements
```

#### 2. Enhanced 5D System (PARTIALLY ACTIVE)
**File:** `sandy/daily_report_pipeline/specialists/enhanced_requirements_extraction.py`
- **Status:** Available but not primary extraction method
- **German Support:** Enhanced patterns for German job descriptions
- **Completeness:** Full 5D implementation with proper data structures

```python
@dataclass
class FiveDimensionalRequirements:
    technical: List[TechnicalRequirement]
    business: List[BusinessRequirement]
    soft_skills: List[SoftSkillRequirement]
    experience: List[ExperienceRequirement]
    education: List[EducationRequirement]
```

#### 3. Technical Extraction Crisis Resolution (ACTIVE)
**File:** `sandy/daily_report_pipeline/specialists/technical_extraction_specialist_v33.py`
- **Purpose:** Fix SAP technology extraction issues
- **Role:** Supplements primary extraction for German technical content
- **Status:** Successfully resolving SAP extraction gaps

---

## 🔄 CURRENT PIPELINE FLOW ANALYSIS

### Daily Report Pipeline V2 (Active)
**File:** `sandy/daily_report_pipeline/run_pipeline_v2.py`

```python
# Current extraction flow:
1. TechnicalExtractionSpecialistV33.extract_technical_requirements_corrected()
   └── Returns: technical_skills, business_skills, soft_skills
   
2. EnhancedRequirementsExtractionV3.extract_requirements() [FALLBACK]
   └── Returns: experience, education only
   
3. RequirementsDisplaySpecialist.format_requirements_for_display()
   └── Formats partial 5D data for reports
```

**Critical Gap Identified:** The pipeline assembles 5D data from multiple sources but doesn't use a unified, comprehensive 5D extraction system.

## 🇩🇪 GERMAN LANGUAGE SUPPORT ANALYSIS

### Current German Patterns (Enhanced Requirements Extractor)
```python
self.experience_patterns = {
    'years_german': r'(\d+)\+?\s*Jahre?\s*(Erfahrung|Berufserfahrung|Praxis)',
    'banking_german': r'\b(Bank|Banking|Finanz|Finance|Treasury|Credit|Risk|Kredit|Bankenumfeld)\b',
    'leadership_german': r'\b(Team|Lead|Manager|Führung|Verantwortung|Leitung|Senior)\b'
}

self.education_patterns = {
    'degree_german': r'\b(Bachelor|Master|Diplom|PhD|Promotion|Studium|BA|MA|MSc|BSc|FH|Universität)\b',
    'field_german': r'\b(Informatik|Wirtschaftsinformatik|BWL|VWL|Mathematik|Physik|Ingenieur|Finance|Banking)\b'
}
```

**Assessment:** Good foundation but not comprehensive enough for Deutsche Bank's German job descriptions.

## 📊 EXTRACTION QUALITY GAPS IDENTIFIED

### 1. Technical Requirements (PARTIALLY ADDRESSED)
- ✅ **Fixed:** SAP technology extraction via TechnicalExtractionSpecialistV33
- ❌ **Gap:** German technical terminology coverage incomplete
- ❌ **Gap:** Financial services technical tools under-represented

### 2. Business Requirements (WEAK)
- ❌ **Gap:** Banking domain knowledge extraction is superficial
- ❌ **Gap:** Deutsche Bank specific business concepts missing
- ❌ **Gap:** Financial regulations and compliance requirements

### 3. Soft Skills (BASIC)
- ❌ **Gap:** German soft skills terminology limited
- ❌ **Gap:** Banking-specific soft skills (client relations, regulatory awareness)
- ❌ **Gap:** Leadership and management skills in German context

### 4. Experience Requirements (INSUFFICIENT)
- ❌ **Gap:** German experience patterns basic
- ❌ **Gap:** Banking career progression understanding weak
- ❌ **Gap:** Project and team leadership experience extraction

### 5. Education Requirements (MINIMAL)
- ❌ **Gap:** German education system terminology incomplete
- ❌ **Gap:** Banking and finance education requirements
- ❌ **Gap:** Professional certifications (German and international)
