## 🔧 LLM Factory Integration Points

### 1. Pipeline Enhancement
```python
# Before classification, add content optimization
job_descriptions = [...] # Your existing job data

# Process batch
optimized_jobs = []
for job in job_descriptions:
    result = specialist.extract_core_content(job.description, job.id)
    
    optimized_jobs.append({
        'id': job.id,
        'original_description': job.description,
        'optimized_description': result.extracted_content,
        'reduction_stats': {
            'percentage': result.reduction_percentage,
            'original_length': len(job.description),
            'optimized_length': len(result.extracted_content)
        },
        'domain_signals': result.domain_signals
    })

# Continue with your existing classification pipeline
classification_results = your_classifier.predict(optimized_jobs)
```

### 2. Monitoring Integration
```python
# Track extraction performance
extraction_metrics = {
    'total_jobs_processed': len(optimized_jobs),
    'average_reduction': sum(job['reduction_stats']['percentage'] for job in optimized_jobs) / len(optimized_jobs),
    'processing_time': total_processing_time,
    'success_rate': successful_extractions / total_jobs_processed
}

# Log for monitoring dashboard
logger.info(f"Content extraction metrics: {extraction_metrics}")
```

### 3. Error Handling & Fallbacks
```python
def safe_content_extraction(description: str, job_id: str):
    try:
        result = specialist.extract_core_content(description, job_id)
        return result.extracted_content
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Content extraction failed for job {job_id}: {e}")
        # Fallback to original content
        return description
```
