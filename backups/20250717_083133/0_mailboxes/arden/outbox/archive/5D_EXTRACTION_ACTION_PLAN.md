- [ ] **Banking/Finance roles** (German regulatory terms)
- [ ] **Consulting roles** (soft skills heavy)
- [ ] **Sales roles** (relationship skills)

### **1.3 Create Test Framework**
- [ ] **Build extraction quality measurement system**
- [ ] **Define "complete extraction" criteria** for each dimension
- [ ] **Create before/after comparison tools**
