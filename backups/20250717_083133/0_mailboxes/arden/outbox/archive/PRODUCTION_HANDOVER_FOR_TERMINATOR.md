## 🚀 QUICK START FOR TERMINATOR

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install python-dotenv logging
```

### Step 2: Integration Pattern
```python
from content_extraction_specialist import ContentExtractionSpecialist

# Initialize once per worker
specialist = ContentExtractionSpecialist()

# Process job descriptions
result = specialist.extract_core_content(raw_job_description, job_id)

# LLM Factory integration
optimized_content = result.extracted_content
reduction_stats = result.reduction_percentage
domain_signals = result.domain_signals
```

### Step 3: Batch Processing
```python
# For your LLM Factory pipeline
results = []
for job_batch in job_batches:
    batch_results = []
    for job in job_batch:
        result = specialist.extract_core_content(job.description, job.id)
        batch_results.append({
            'job_id': job.id,
            'optimized_content': result.extracted_content,
            'reduction_percentage': result.reduction_percentage,
            'processing_time': '<2s',
            'success': True
        })
    results.extend(batch_results)
```
