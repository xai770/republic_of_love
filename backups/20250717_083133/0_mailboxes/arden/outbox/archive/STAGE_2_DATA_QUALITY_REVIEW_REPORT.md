## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IDENTIFIED ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **üîß CRITICAL ISSUE: Match Scoring Bug**

**Problem Identified:**
- **Experience Requirements Match**: 0.0% on ALL jobs
- **Education Requirements Match**: 0.0% on ALL jobs  
- **Other scores**: Technical (82%), Business (88%), Soft Skills (75%) working correctly

**Root Cause Analysis:**
This appears to be a **scoring algorithm bug**, NOT a data quality issue because:
1. Experience/Education data IS being extracted (visible in 5D analysis)
2. Other match scores are working and show reasonable values
3. All jobs showing identical 0.0% suggests systematic scoring failure

**Recommendation:**
```
URGENT: Fix match scoring algorithm for Experience and Education dimensions
- Data quality is excellent
- Extraction is working perfectly  
- Scoring calculation needs debugging
```

### **üìà MINOR IMPROVEMENTS SUGGESTED**

1. **Application Decision Logic**: Currently showing `"Decision analysis required"` for all jobs
   - Recommend implementing automated decision thresholds
   - Use overall match scores for initial filtering

2. **Business Requirements Depth**: Some jobs show `"Business requirements extraction needed"`
   - Could benefit from domain-specific prompts for niche roles
   - Overall quality still very good
