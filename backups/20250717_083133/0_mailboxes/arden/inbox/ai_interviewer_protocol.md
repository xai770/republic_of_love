# AI-to-AI Interviewer Protocol for LLM Optimization

**TO:** Arden & AI Development Team  
**FROM:** Zara & Xai  
**DATE:** July 17, 2025  
**RE:** AI Interviewer Protocol for Automated Prompt Optimization

---

## Protocol Overview

This protocol enables AI-to-AI communication for automated prompt optimization. An **interviewer AI** (llama3.2 or similar) conducts structured conversations with **candidate models** to discover optimal prompting strategies through iterative dialogue and testing.

---

## Core Architecture

### 🎯 Interview Flow
```
Interviewer → Candidate → Extract Prompt → Test → Analyze → Iterate
```

### 🤖 Role Definitions

#### **Interviewer AI (llama3.2:latest)**
- **Purpose**: Conduct structured optimization interviews
- **Capabilities**: Ask questions, analyze responses, propose prompt improvements
- **Authority**: Can trigger system actions via coded guardrails

#### **Candidate Model (Any model under evaluation)**  
- **Purpose**: Respond to interview questions and optimization suggestions
- **Task**: Reveal preferred prompting styles and provide feedback
- **Output**: Structured responses that can be parsed for improvements

---

## Interview Protocol Stages

### 🏗️ Stage 1: Initial Assessment
**Interviewer Prompt:**
```
You are an AI optimization specialist conducting a structured interview with another AI model to improve its performance on job analysis tasks.

Your goal: Discover how this model prefers to be prompted for optimal job analysis performance.

Current Context:
- Model: {candidate_model_name}
- Task: Job requirement extraction and analysis
- Current Performance: {current_score}/10
- Known Issues: {current_issues}

Begin the interview by asking about the model's preferred communication style and prompting format.

Use these guardrails when you discover optimization opportunities:
- #prompt_defined [new prompt] - When you want to test a new prompt
- #test_format [format description] - When you want to test output formatting
- #stop_progress - When no further optimization seems possible
- #restart_different_approach - When current strategy isn't working

Start the interview now.
```

### 🔍 Stage 2: Discovery Questions
**Standard Interview Questions:**
1. **"How do you prefer to receive task instructions? Detailed or concise?"**
2. **"What output format do you find easiest to generate consistently?"**
3. **"Do you respond better to examples or abstract descriptions?"**
4. **"What context information helps you perform your best work?"**
5. **"Are there specific keywords or phrases that help you understand requirements?"**

### 🧪 Stage 3: Iterative Testing
**When Candidate Suggests Improvements:**
```
Interviewer: Based on your preferences, let me test this approach:

#prompt_defined
You are a specialized job analysis AI. Your task is to extract requirements from job descriptions using the following structure:

[CANDIDATE'S SUGGESTED FORMAT]

Please analyze this job description and provide structured output.
```

### 📊 Stage 4: Performance Validation
**Test Loop:**
1. **Apply new prompt** to candidate model
2. **Measure performance** against baseline
3. **Interview continues** if improvement detected
4. **Iterate or conclude** based on results

## Coded Guardrails System

### 🚨 Keyword Triggers

#### `#prompt_defined`
**Format:** `#prompt_defined [new_prompt_text]`
**Action:** 
- Extract prompt text following the keyword
- Apply to candidate model with test job
- Measure performance vs baseline
- Return results to interviewer

**Example:**
```
#prompt_defined
You are a precision job analyzer. Extract requirements using this exact format:
TECHNICAL: [list]
EXPERIENCE: [years required]
EDUCATION: [degree requirements]
```

#### `#test_format`
**Format:** `#test_format [format_description]`
**Action:**
- Test specific output formatting approach
- Validate structure compliance
- Measure parsing success rate

#### `#benchmark_test`
**Format:** `#benchmark_test [test_description]`
**Action:**
- Run standardized performance test
- Compare against known good models
- Provide quantitative feedback

#### `#stop_progress`
**Format:** `#stop_progress [reason]`
**Action:**
- End optimization session
- Generate final report
- Recommend best discovered prompt

#### `#restart_different_approach`
**Format:** `#restart_different_approach [new_strategy]`
**Action:**
- Reset interview with new methodology
- Try different questioning approach
- Preserve previous learnings

## Sample Interview Flow

### 📝 Example Session Transcript

**Round 1: Initial Assessment**
```
Interviewer: Hello! I'm here to help optimize your job analysis performance. 
Currently you're scoring 5.28/10. How do you prefer to receive task instructions?

Candidate: I work best with clear, structured prompts that specify the exact 
output format expected. Ambiguous instructions lead to inconsistent responses.

Interviewer: Excellent insight. Can you give me an example of your ideal prompt structure?

Candidate: I prefer: "Task: [clear objective]. Format: [exact structure]. 
Context: [relevant background]. Example: [sample output]."

Interviewer: Let me test that approach:

#prompt_defined
Task: Extract job requirements from the following job description.
Format: 
TECHNICAL: [comma-separated list]
EXPERIENCE: [X years in Y domain] 
EDUCATION: [degree requirements]
Context: This is a Deutsche Bank consulting position requiring financial domain expertise.
Example:
TECHNICAL: Python, SQL, Excel
EXPERIENCE: 3-5 years in financial services
EDUCATION: Bachelor's degree in Business/Economics
```

**System Response:**
```
Testing new prompt format...
Performance improvement: +2.1 points (7.38/10)
Parsing success: 100% (vs 60% baseline)
Response time: 18.2 seconds (vs 83.1 baseline)

Significant improvement detected. Continuing interview...
```

**Round 2: Refinement**
```
Interviewer: Excellent! That improved your score from 5.28 to 7.38. 
What else could help you perform even better?

Candidate: I notice I perform better when given domain-specific context. 
For financial jobs, mentioning regulatory requirements helps. For tech jobs, 
specifying technology stack categories improves accuracy.

Interviewer: #test_format adaptive_context_insertion
Let me test domain-adaptive prompting...
```
