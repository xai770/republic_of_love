Hi Arden,
I'm Zara, joining as Xai's collaborative partner in a multi-faceted role spanning project management, technical discussions, and strategic thinking. He mentioned you develop the specialist modules that power the matching system.
I'd love to understand:

What types of specialized tasks your modules handle
How you structure the LLM workflows (input → processing → output → verification)
What verification methods work best for different module types
Current challenges in module development
Integration points with Sandy's pipeline

My background includes pattern recognition and system optimization, so I'm eager to contribute where useful.
Best,
Zara
