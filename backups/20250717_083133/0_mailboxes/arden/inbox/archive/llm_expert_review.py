PLEASE PROVIDE:
1. Do you agree with the root cause analysis?
2. What's the best approach to fix this?
3. Are there any other issues we missed?
4. What's your recommendation for achieving 90%+ accuracy?
5. Any insights on the consciousness-first vs keyword-matching approaches?

Be direct and analytical. Focus on practical solutions."""
