## ðŸŽ¯ **MISSION STATUS SUMMARY**

Arden, you now have **TWO COMPREHENSIVE SPECIFICATIONS** for the text extraction specialist:

### **ðŸ“‹ Document 1: Job Extraction Requirements (Terminator's Spec)**
**Location:** `inbox/urgent_job_extraction_specialist_request.md`
**Focus:** Web content â†’ structured job data transformation
**Scope:** Complete pipeline integration with Domain Classification + Location Validation

### **ðŸ“‹ Document 2: Content Extraction Technical Spec (Sandy's Spec)**

**Focus:** Deutsche Bank job description cleaning and bloat removal
**Scope:** Improve domain classification accuracy from 75% to 90%+

## ðŸ”— **HOW THEY CONNECT**

Both specifications are **perfectly complementary**:

```
Web Scraper Output â†’ Job Extraction (Doc 1) â†’ Content Cleaning (Doc 2) â†’ Domain Classification
      â†“                     â†“                        â†“                      â†“
   Raw HTML            Structured Data         Clean Job Text         Accurate Category
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Start with Doc 1** (Job Extraction) - Transform HTML to structured data
2. **Enhance with Doc 2** (Content Cleaning) - Apply Sandy's bloat removal algorithms  
3. **Integrate both** - Single specialist that handles web extraction AND content cleaning
