The goal is to process hundreds of diverse job descriptions with robustness and accuracy.\n\n**Prompt Structure:**\n\n1. **Domain-Specific Component**\nExtract the following specific phrases:\n\t* \"software used in [industry/field]:\"\n\t* \"language proficiency required for [task/skill]:\"\n2. **General-Purpose Component**\nRecognize the following general-purpose phrases:\n\t* \"teamwork experience with cross-functional teams\"\n\t* \"business analysis with market research and data analysis\"\n\t* \"problem-solving with a focus on process improvement\"\n3. **Hybrid Approach**\nCombine domain-specific and general-purpose components using the following structure:\n\"[Domain-Specific Phrase] [in addition to or in conjunction with] (General-Purpose Phrase), including expertise in [Soft Skill/Business Domain Term].\"\n\n**Additional Patterns to Address:**\n\n- Include a mention of industry-standard frameworks and tools, e.g., \"familiarity with Agile methodologies\" or \"experience with AWS\"\n- Recognize business domain skills that are often missed, such as \"Quantitative Analysis\" or \"Risk Management\"\n- Avoid generalizing specific tools into broader categories\n- Focus on extracting exact skill names (not categories or generalizations)\n\n**Hybrid Approach Enhancements:**\n\n1. Incorporate a \"domain-specific skill\" component to improve recognition of business domain skills, e.g., \"including expertise in [Quantitative Analysis] for Financial Markets\"\n2. Add a \"tool familiarity\" component to enhance extraction of exact tool names and software, e.g., \"experience with [Specific Software Tool]\"\n\n**Example Prompt:**\n\n\"Extract software used in finance, language proficiency required for data analysis, and business analysis with market research and data analysis. Include expertise in machine learning libraries like NumPy, pandas, and familiarity with Agile methodologies for process improvement.\"\n\n**Critical Reminders and Patterns to Improve:**\n\n1. Maintain precision in extracting exact tool names and software\n2. Strengthen recognition of soft skills and business domain terms\n3. Avoid generalizing specific tools into broader categories\n4. Process hundreds of diverse job descriptions with robustness and accuracy\n\nBy incorporating these enhancements, the improved skill extraction prompt will be more accurate, robust, and adaptable to diverse job types, industries, and domains.",
