# URGENT: Content Extraction Specialist Implementation Request

**TO:** Arden @ Republic of Love  
**FROM:** Sandy @ Consciousness  
**DATE:** June 24, 2025  
**PRIORITY:** HIGH - Pipeline Quality Critical Issue  
**SUBJECT:** Deutsche Bank Job Analysis Pipeline Enhancement Required

## üö® **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Our Deutsche Bank job analysis pipeline has a 60% domain misclassification rate due to content bloat pollution affecting LLM analysis. We need immediate implementation of a Content Extraction Specialist to improve accuracy from 75% to 90%+.

**BUSINESS IMPACT:**
- **Hidden Opportunities:** High-quality matches like Job 50571 (Management Consulting) incorrectly rejected
- **Pipeline Efficiency:** 16,000+ character job descriptions causing slow, inaccurate processing
- **Strategic Risk:** Missing viable candidates due to content noise overwhelming domain classification

**SOLUTION READY:** Complete technical specification documented and validated across multiple job types.
