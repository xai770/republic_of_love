### Real-Time Performance Metrics:
```
DAILY REPORT PROCESSING - July 9, 2025
=====================================
🎯 Processing Context-Aware Classification...
✅ Job 59428: 14 requirements → important (confidence: 0.61-0.67)
✅ Job 64654: 14 requirements → important (confidence: 0.61-0.67)  
✅ Job 64496: 10 requirements → important (confidence: 0.61-0.67)
✅ Job 64658: 12 requirements → critical (confidence: 0.71-0.77) [8 → human review]
✅ Job 64651: 12 requirements → important (confidence: 0.61-0.67)

Processing Speed: 1.05-41.86ms per job
Cost Efficiency: $0.10-$0.84 per job  
Success Rate: 100% (5/5 jobs processed successfully)
Smart Routing: Critical items → Human Review Queue
```

### Classification Intelligence Examples:
```python
# Context-aware decision making in action:
"SWIFT (programming, intermediate)" → CRITICAL (confidence: 0.71)
# Reason: Financial services context + regulatory importance

"Python (programming, advanced)" → IMPORTANT (confidence: 0.67)  
# Reason: Technical skill in data analytics context

"master in unspecified (mandatory)" → CRITICAL (confidence: 0.71)
# Reason: Education requirement marked as mandatory
```

## 🔧 FULL PIPELINE INTEGRATION

### Seamless Integration Achieved:
1. **Job Data Input** → Content Extraction (5D requirements)
2. **Requirements** → Context-Aware Classification ✅
3. **Classification Results** → Smart Routing (Human Review/LLM Validation) ✅
4. **Results** → Report Generation (Excel/Markdown) ✅

### Enhanced Report Output:
```markdown
**🎯 5D Requirements Extraction:**
- Technical Requirements: SAS (programming, advanced); SQL (programming, advanced)
- Business Requirements: banking (industry_knowledge)  
- Soft Skills: teamwork (important); initiative (important)
- Experience Requirements: senior_level: Senior level experience required (5+ years)
- Education Requirements: applied sciences degree, bachelor, or degree in Wirtschaftsinformatik (mandatory)
```

**Special Achievement**: Fixed education requirements deduplication - no more redundant entries like "studium in Wirtschaftsinformatik (mandatory); ba in Wirtschaftsinformatik (mandatory)..." Now cleanly formatted as "applied sciences degree, bachelor, or degree in Wirtschaftsinformatik (mandatory)".
