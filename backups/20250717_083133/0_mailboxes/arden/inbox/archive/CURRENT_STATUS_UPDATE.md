## ESCALATION RATIONALE

This aligns perfectly with the original escalation request to Arden. The four-specialist architecture is working well for technical roles but needs optimization for:

1. **Administrative positions** (Personal Assistant, Office Manager, etc.)
2. **Soft-skill heavy roles** (HR, Customer Service, etc.)
3. **General business roles** with mixed skill requirements

## ARDEN'S EXPERTISE NEEDED

Your original four-specialist architecture is solid, but we need your optimization expertise to:

1. **Improve soft-skill extraction** accuracy
2. **Enhance administrative role handling**
3. **Maintain 100% format compliance** while boosting accuracy
4. **Achieve 85%+ minimum** for production deployment

## FILES READY FOR REVIEW

All escalation package files are complete and current:
- Latest validation results: 78.3% accuracy

**STATUS:** Ready for Arden's architectural optimization work.
