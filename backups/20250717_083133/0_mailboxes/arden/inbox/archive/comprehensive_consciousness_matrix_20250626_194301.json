They also provided a job description for a Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Lead role. The user wants me to extract skills from the job description.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out why the error is happening. The error message suggests that the client is trying to connect to a server at localhost:11434, which isn't responding. Maybe the user is using a service like Llama.cpp or another local model server that runs on that port. If the server isn't running, the connection times out. But the user's main request is about extracting skills from the job description, so maybe they're trying to use the model to extract skills but the model isn't running.\n\nWait, the user might have tried to run a model and got this error, but the actual task is to extract skills. So I should focus on the job description. Let me read through the job description again to identify the key skills mentioned.\n\nThe job requires a strong understanding of vulnerability management frameworks like CVSS, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CSF, OWASP. Then, hands-on experience with tools like Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7, and SIEM platforms like Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel. Familiarity with GCP's native security tools. Knowledge of secure coding practices and DevSecOps, including CI/CD integration. Experience with threat modeling, penetration testing, red teaming. Ability to work independently and in a team, manage ambiguity, handle multiple priorities. Excellent communication and documentation skills, fluency in English.\n\nI should list these skills in a structured way. Maybe group them into categories like Technical Skills, Methodologies, Tools, etc. But the user just wants the skills extracted, so a bullet list should suffice. Make sure not to include any information about the error, since the user's main request is about the skills. Also, check if there are any other skills mentioned, like cross-functional collaboration or reporting to leadership, but those are more about responsibilities than skills. Focus on the specific technical and methodological skills listed.\n</think>\n\n**Extracted Skills from the Job Description:**\n\n1. **Vulnerability Management Frameworks:**  \n   - CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)  \n   - MITRE ATT&CK  \n   - NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)  \n   - CSF (Cybersecurity Framework)  \n   - OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)  \n\n2. **Tools & Technologies:**  \n   - Vulnerability Scanning Tools: Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7  \n   - SIEM Platforms: Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel  \n   - Cloud Security: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) native security tools  \n   - DevSecOps & CI/CD Integration: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipelines  \n\n3. **Methodologies & Practices:**  \n   - Threat Modeling  \n   - Penetration Testing  \n   - Red Teaming  \n   - Secure Coding Practices  \n\n4. **Soft Skills:**  \n   - Cross-functional collaboration (Cybersecurity, Technology, Business teams)  \n   - Independent work and teamwork  \n   - Ambiguity management in dynamic environments  \n   - Multi-tasking and prioritization  \n   - Excellent communication (written and spoken English)  \n   - Analytical and problem-solving skills  \n\n5. **Reporting & Governance:**  \n   - Developing and tracking KPIs/KRIs for program effectiveness  \n   - Reporting to senior leadership and risk committees  \n\n**Note:** The error message you encountered (`HTTPConnectionPool` timeout) likely relates to a local service (e.g., Llama.cpp, Ollama, or another model server) running on `localhost:11434`. Ensure the service is active or adjust the connection parameters. Let me know if you need further clarification!"

        "soft_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to extract only the interpersonal, communication, and management skills from the given job description. Let me start by reading through the job description carefully.\n\nFirst, the position is for a Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Lead. The key responsibilities mention working cross-functionally with technology, security, and business teams. That sounds like a teamwork or interpersonal skill. Also, the responsibilities include developing KPIs and KRI's, providing reporting to senior leadership, which might relate to communication and management.\n\nLooking at the \"Your skills and experience\" section, there's a mention of \"Excellent communication and documentation skills\" and \"Strong communication skills including being fluent in English (written and spoken)\". These are definitely communication skills. Also, \"Ability to work independently and as part of a team\" is an interpersonal skill. \n\nUnder soft skills, the job description lists \"Ability to work with some level of ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and manage multiple priorities\" which might fall under management skills. Also, \"Strong analytical and problem-solving skills\" could be considered a management or interpersonal skill, but the user specified to extract only interpersonal, communication, and management. \n\nWait, the user wants exact terms only. Let me check again. The exact terms in the job description that fit these categories. \n\nFrom the responsibilities: \"Work cross-functionally with technology, security, and business teams\" \u2013 that's teamwork, which is interpersonal. \n\nIn the skills section: \"Excellent communication and documentation skills\" and \"Strong communication skills including being fluent in English (written and spoken)\" are communication. \n\nAlso, \"Ability to work independently and as part of a team\" is interpersonal. \n\nIn the soft skills section: \"Ability to work with some level of ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and manage multiple priorities\" \u2013 that's management. \n\nAlso, \"Strong analytical and problem-solving skills\" might be management or interpersonal, but the user might want only the exact terms mentioned. Wait, the user said \"exact terms only\", so I need to look for the exact phrases used in the job description. \n\nLooking back, the job description under \"Your skills and experience\" has \"Excellent communication and documentation skills\" and \"Strong communication skills including being fluent in English (written and spoken)\". \n\nIn the soft skills section, it says \"Ability to work with some level of ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and manage multiple priorities\". \n\nAlso, \"Ability to work independently and as part of a team\" is mentioned in the \"Your skills and experience\" section. \n\nSo compiling these exact terms: \n\nInterpersonal: \"Ability to work independently and as part of a team\"\n\nCommunication: \"Excellent communication and documentation skills\", \"Strong communication skills including being fluent in English (written and spoken)\"\n\nManagement: \"Ability to work with some level of ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and manage multiple priorities\"\n\nWait, the user might consider \"manage multiple priorities\" as a management skill. Also, \"work cross-functionally\" is part of the responsibilities, but the exact term is \"work cross-functionally with technology, security, and business teams\". But the user wants exact terms from the job description. However, the job description doesn't use the exact term \"interpersonal skills\" or \"communication skills\" but rather phrases like \"Excellent communication and documentation skills\". \n\nThe user wants only the exact terms from the job description. So the exact terms would be:\n\n- Excellent communication and documentation skills\n- Strong communication skills including being fluent in English (written and spoken)\n- Ability to work independently and as part of a team\n- Ability to work with some level of ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and manage multiple priorities\n\nBut the user might want to separate them into the three categories. The question is to extract only interpersonal, communication, and management skills. So:\n\nCommunication skills: \"Excellent communication and documentation skills\", \"Strong communication skills including being fluent in English (written and spoken)\"\n\nInterpersonal skills: \"Ability to work independently and as part of a team\"\n\nManagement skills: \"Ability to work with some level of ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and manage multiple priorities\"\n\nSo the exact terms are as listed. Need to make sure I don't include any other terms. The rest are technical skills like vulnerability management frameworks, tools, etc., which are not in the specified categories. So the answer should be those exact terms.\n</think>\n\nExcellent communication and documentation skills  \nStrong communication skills including being fluent in English (written and spoken)  \nAbility to work independently and as part of a team  \nAbility to work with some level of ambiguity in a dynamic environment, and manage multiple priorities",

The job is for a Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management Lead at DWS. So, the domain is cybersecurity, specifically vulnerability management. Industry-specific methodologies would be the frameworks, tools, and practices mentioned in the job description.\n\nLooking at the job description, the key responsibilities mention frameworks like CVSS, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CSF, OWASP.

Then there are tools like Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7 for vulnerability scanning, and SIEM platforms like Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel. \n\nThe skills section mentions cloud security in GCP, secure coding practices, DevSecOps principles, CI/CD pipeline integration, threat modeling, penetration testing, and red teaming methodologies. These are all specific to the industry. Also, the role involves working with Threat Intelligence and Incident Response teams, which are part of the cybersecurity domain.\n\nI need to make sure I don't include any general skills like communication or problem-solving, since the user wants only the domain-specific terms. Also, check for any other methodologies mentioned. The job talks about governance, automation, best practices, and KPIs/KRIs, but those might be more about management rather than specific methodologies. \n\nWait, the user said \"industry-specific methodologies\". So frameworks and tools are methodologies. For example, DevSecOps is a methodology. Threat modeling is a methodology. Penetration testing and red teaming are also methodologies. \n\nLet me list out all the exact terms. The frameworks: CVSS, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CSF, OWASP. Tools: Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel. Cloud security: GCP native security tools. Secure coding practices, DevSecOps principles, CI/CD pipeline integration. Threat modeling, penetration testing, red teaming methodologies. \n\nAlso, the role mentions working with Threat Intelligence and Incident Response teams, but those are teams, not methodologies. The user might want the methodologies related to the work. \n\nI think that's all. Let me compile them into a list without any explanations, just the exact terms as specified.\n</think>\n\nBusiness domain skills:  \nCVSS, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST, CSF, OWASP, Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Rapid7, Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel, GCP, DevSecOps, CI/CD pipeline integration, threat modeling, penetration testing, red teaming, secure coding practices, cloud security, vulnerability scanning, SIEM platforms, vulnerability management frameworks, automation, governance, risk assessment, incident response, threat intelligence, remediation, KPIs, KRI, regulatory compliance, enterprise-wide vulnerability management, secure application development, third-party vendor security, cloud environments, application security, infrastructure security, security posture, risk committees, cybersecurity frameworks, secure DevOps, automated security testing, cross-functional collaboration, vulnerability prioritization, exploit risk assessment, remediation governance, business team collaboration"
