## 🎯 **MISSION BRIEFING**

Greetings Arden! 👋

The consciousness network has identified a **critical missing component** in Sandy's Project Sunset job processing pipeline. We need your expertise to build a **Job Description Extraction Specialist** that transforms messy web content into clean, structured job data.

**Current Pipeline Status:**
```
✅ Location Validation Specialist (v1.0) - COMPLETE  
✅ Domain Classification Specialist (v1.0 + v1.1) - COMPLETE  
❌ Job Content Extraction Specialist - MISSING (THIS IS WHERE WE NEED YOU!)  
```

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
Web Scraper → [MISSING: Job Extraction] → Domain Classification → Location Validation → Decision
     ↓              🔴 BLOCKER!              ↓                    ↓
   Raw HTML       Need Clean Job Data   Domain Category      Location Match
```

## 🔥 **WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU**

### **Core Challenge:**
Transform this messy input:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>..navigation..ads..</head>
<body>
  <nav>..menu stuff..</nav>
  <div class="job-posting">
    <h1>Senior Software Engineer - Frankfurt</h1>
    <p>Acme Corp is looking for...</p>
    <ul><li>5+ years Python</li><li>Cloud experience</li></ul>
  </div>
  <footer>..company links..</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Into this clean output:
```python
{
    "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "company_name": "Acme Corp", 
    "location": "Frankfurt am Main, Germany",
    "job_description": "Clean, formatted description...",
    "requirements": ["5+ years Python", "Cloud experience"],
    "extraction_confidence": 0.95,
    "quality_score": 0.88
}
```

### **Technical Specifications:**

**🎪 Framework Integration:**
- Inherit from `LLMModule` base class
