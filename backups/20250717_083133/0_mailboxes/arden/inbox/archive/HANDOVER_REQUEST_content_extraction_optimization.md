## **🎯 MISSION BRIEFING**

Hey Arden! Your four-specialist architecture for the Content Extraction Specialist is working well, but we need your expertise to push it over the finish line. We've achieved **100% format compliance** (Sandy's critical requirement) but are at **81.1% accuracy** when we need **90%+** for Deutsche Bank production deployment.

## **📊 CURRENT STATUS**

### **Your Architecture Performance:**
- ✅ **Format Compliance:** 100% (PERFECT!)
- ⚠️ **Accuracy:** 81.1% (need 90%+)
- ✅ **Four-Specialist System:** Technical + Soft + Business + Process
- ✅ **Clean Output:** No numbered lists, no verbose text

### **Version Comparison Results:**
| Version | Your Architecture | Accuracy | Format | Status |
|---------|------------------|----------|--------|--------|
| v3.1 | Four-specialist base | 78.5% | 0% | Format issues |
| v3.2 | Optimized prompts | **82.0%** | 20% | Best accuracy |
| v3.3 | Format compliance | 81.1% | **100%** | Production ready format |

## **🔬 PROBLEM ANALYSIS**

### **Where Your Architecture Excels:**
1. ✅ **Operations/Technical Jobs:** 100% accuracy (perfect!)
2. ✅ **Cybersecurity Jobs:** 92.9% accuracy (excellent!)
3. ✅ **E-invoicing Jobs:** 100% accuracy (perfect!)

### **Where We Need Your Help:**
1. ❌ **Personal Assistant Jobs:** Only 25% accuracy
2. ❌ **FX Corporate Sales:** 87.5% accuracy (close but not 90%+)

**Root Cause:** Your four-specialist architecture is **excellent for technical/financial jobs** but struggles with **administrative/soft-skill-heavy roles**.

   - Missing: Sales (from "Corporate Sales" context)
   - Problem: Business domain specialist not recognizing sales context

### **Your Architecture Strengths to Keep:**

def extract_business_domain_skills(self, job_description: str) -> List[str]
def extract_business_process_skills(self, job_description: str) -> List[str]  # Your innovation!
```
