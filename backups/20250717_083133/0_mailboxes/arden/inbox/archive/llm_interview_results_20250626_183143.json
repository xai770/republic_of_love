  "llm_advice": "I'd love to collaborate with you on this challenge.\n\n**Prompt Design:**\n\nTo extract the exact skills, especially business/soft skills, I would design a prompt that incorporates the following elements:\n\n1. **Domain-specific context**: Provide a brief context about the job description and the industry (e.g., \"FX Corporate Sales - Analyst - Associate Job ID: R0383730\").\n2. **Explicit skill definitions**: Include explicit definitions of the expected skills, such as:\n\"Extract relevant skills related to FX trading, risk management, client relationship management, sales, hedge accounting, and quantitative analysis from the job description.\"\n3. **Precise term targeting**: Use specific phrases or keywords to target the desired skills, like:\n\"Target skill terms: 'FX Trading', 'Risk Management Solutions', 'Client Relationship Management', 'Sales', 'Hedge Accounting' (and their variants)\"\n4. **Domain knowledge cues**: Incorporate domain-specific knowledge cues to help the model recognize industry-specific terminology, such as:\n\"Industries mentioned in job description: finance, energy, healthcare\"\n5. **Soft skill detection**: Include instructions to detect soft skills like \"Client Relationship Management\", which might be harder to extract than technical tools.\n6. **Contextual scoring**: Emphasize the importance of context and relevance when extracting skills. For example:\n\"Prioritize skills that appear in the job description's main content, rather than just in titles or abstracts.\"\n\nHere's an example prompt:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nExtract relevant skills related to FX trading, risk management, client relationship management, sales, hedge accounting, and quantitative analysis from the following job description:\nFX Corporate Sales - Analyst - Associate Job ID: R0383730\nFull/Part-Time: Full-time Regular/Temporary: Regular Listed: 2025-06-11 Location: New York\nIndustries mentioned in job description: finance, energy, healthcare\n\nTarget skill terms: 'FX Trading', 'Risk Management Solutions', 'Client Relationship Management', 'Sales', 'Hedge Accounting' (and their variants)\nPrioritize skills that appear in the job description's main content, rather than just in titles or abstracts.\n\n**Why business domain skills are harder to extract:**\n\nI believe business domain skills like FX trading and risk management are harder to extract for several reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of explicit definitions**: Business domain terms might not be explicitly defined or standardized across industries.\n2. **Domain-specific jargon**: Industry-specific terminology can be nuanced and context-dependent, making it challenging to detect and extract accurately.\n3. **Generalization by LLMs**: Large language models (LLMs) often generalize business domain skills into broader categories, losing the precision of specific terms like \"FX Trading\".\n4. **Domain knowledge limitations**: While LLMs are excellent at understanding general concepts, their domain knowledge might not be as comprehensive or up-to-date as that of a human expert in a specific industry.\n\nBy designing prompts with these factors in mind, we can help the model extract business domain skills more accurately and preserve the exact terms.",
