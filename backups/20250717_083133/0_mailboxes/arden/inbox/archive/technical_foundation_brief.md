### **Key Design Patterns You'll Love:**

**1. Specialist Pattern:**
```python
class BaseSpecialist(LLMModule):
    """Every specialist follows this pattern"""
    def process(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> ModuleResult:
        # 1. Validate input
        # 2. Generate LLM prompt
        # 3. Get LLM response
        # 4. Parse and validate output
        # 5. Return structured result
```

**2. Registry Auto-Discovery:**
```python
# Specialists auto-register based on directory structure
specialists_versioned/
├── specialist_name/v1_0/
│   ├── config.yaml        # Auto-discovered
│   ├── __init__.py        # Auto-imported
│   └── src/specialist.py  # Auto-loaded
```

**3. Versioned Deployment:**
- Multiple versions can coexist
- Zero-downtime upgrades
- Instant rollback capability
- A/B testing between versions

---

## 🎓 CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE: WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL

### **1. The Adversarial Consensus Innovation**
This is our secret weapon:
```python
# Revolutionary approach to AI reliability
initial_assessment = specialist.evaluate(data)
adversarial_challenge = adversarial_generator.challenge(initial_assessment)
adversarial_assessment = specialist.evaluate_with_challenge(adversarial_challenge)
final_result = consensus_engine.reconcile(initial_assessment, adversarial_assessment)
```

**Why this is revolutionary:** Prevents overconfident AI, exposes biases, creates nuanced outputs.

### **2. The Scientific Development Methodology**
We don't just build specialists - we **scientifically develop** them:
- Hypothesis-driven development
- A/B testing with statistical validation
- Performance correlation analysis
- Reproducible research methodology

### **3. The Human-First Design Philosophy**
Every specialist is designed to **empower humans, not replace them**:
- Conservative bias towards human review
- Explainable AI with reasoning chains
- Graceful degradation when uncertain
- Quality thresholds that protect users

        super().__init__(config, name="your_specialist", 
                        description="What it does", version="1.0")
    
    def process(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> ModuleResult:
        # Follow the validated pattern
```

**✅ Implement comprehensive error handling**
```python
try:
    # Your specialist logic
    result = self._process_with_llm(input_data)
    return ModuleResult(success=True, data=result, processing_time=elapsed)
except Exception as e:
    return ModuleResult(success=False, 
                       data={"error": str(e)}, 
                       processing_time=elapsed)

### **LLM Integration Mastery:**
```python
# Our proven pattern for Ollama integration
class YourSpecialist:
    def _generate_response(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        try:
            # Use only supported parameters
            response = self.ollama_client.generate(
                model=self.config.models[0],
                prompt=prompt,
                stream=False  # Critical: Don't use unsupported params
            )
            # Handle direct string response
            return response if isinstance(response, str) else response.get('response', '')
        except Exception as e:
            self.logger.error(f"LLM generation failed: {e}")
            raise
```

### **JSON Response Parsing (Battle-Tested):**
```python
def _parse_llm_response(self, response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Our robust parsing approach"""
    try:
        # Strategy 1: Direct JSON parsing
        return json.loads(response)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Strategy 2: Extract JSON from text
        json_match = re.search(r'\{.*\}', response, re.DOTALL)
        if json_match:
            return json.loads(json_match.group(0))
        # Strategy 3: Fallback parsing with error handling
        return self._create_fallback_response(response)
```

### **Performance Optimization Secrets:**
```python
# Lazy loading pattern
class SpecialistRegistry:
    def __init__(self):
        self._specialists = {}  # Cache loaded specialists
        self._configs = {}      # Cache configurations
    
    def load_specialist(self, name: str, config: ModuleConfig):
        cache_key = f"{name}_{id(config)}"
        if cache_key not in self._specialists:
            self._specialists[cache_key] = self._create_specialist(name, config)
        return self._specialists[cache_key]
```
