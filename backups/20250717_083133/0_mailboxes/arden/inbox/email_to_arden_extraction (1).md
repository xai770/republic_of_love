# Email to Arden - Understanding Current State

Hi Arden,

I'm looking at the daily report output and trying to understand the current state of requirements extraction. Not looking to jump into solutions yet - just want to understand how we got to where we are.

## What I'm Observing

In the output data, I see:
- Generic outputs like "Decision analysis required" instead of specific extracted requirements
- Template-like responses rather than job-specific content

## Help Me Understand

Could you help me map out the current reality?

**Current Flow:**
- Which specialists are supposed to handle requirements extraction?
- Are they actually running in the current pipeline?
- What does the extraction output look like when it works vs. what we're seeing now?

**The Journey So Far:**
- How did we arrive at the current specialist architecture?
- What challenges emerged during development that led to the current state?
- Where do you think the extraction process is getting stuck?

**Deutsche Bank Job Postings:**
- Any patterns you've noticed in how these postings are structured?
- What makes them easy or difficult to parse?
- Are there specific sections or formats that trip up the extraction?

I'm not looking to propose solutions yet - just want to understand the landscape before thinking about next steps.

Best,  
Zara
