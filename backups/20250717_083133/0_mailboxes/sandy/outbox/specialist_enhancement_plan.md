# Specialist Enhancement Plan
## Integration of Enhanced Skill Extractor Logic into Daily Report Pipeline

**Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Author:** Sandy  
**Priority:** HIGH - Critical for complete field extraction  
**Status:** Planning Phase  

---

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Integrate the proven logic and prompts from `skill_extractor_enhanced_v2.py` into the daily report pipeline to resolve missing field extractions:
- Technical Requirements
- Business Requirements 
- Soft Skills
- Experience Requirements

## üìä CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### ‚úÖ Working Components
- Basic pipeline execution (3 jobs processed successfully)
- Location validation working with `LocationValidationSpecialistV3`
- Excel report generation functioning
- Skill extraction partially working (2/3 jobs successful)

### ‚ùå Missing/Broken Components
- **Technical Requirements:** "Not extracted" 
- **Business Requirements:** "Not extracted"
- **Soft Skills:** "Not extracted" 
- **Experience Requirements:** "Not extracted"
- **Education Requirements:** Working but could be enhanced

### üîç Root Cause
Current `daily_report_pipeline/specialists/skill_extraction/specialist.py` doesn't provide the structured output needed for the Excel generator fields.

## üèóÔ∏è ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Specialist Creation (IMMEDIATE)
Create new specialists based on `skill_extractor_enhanced_v2.py`:

1. **requirements_extractor_v1.py** 
   - Extract: Technical Requirements, Business Requirements
   - Use Gemma3n strategic prompts from v2.0
   - Output structured data for Excel compatibility

2. **skills_categorizer_v1.py**
   - Extract: Soft Skills, Experience Requirements, Education Requirements
   - Use 5-bucket framework from enhanced extractor
   - Provide granular skill categorization

3. **job_analyzer_v1.py** 
   - Orchestrate all extractions
   - Ensure field mapping to Excel generator expectations
   - Handle fallbacks gracefully

### Phase 2: Pipeline Integration (NEXT)
1. Rename `clean_pipeline_v6.py` to `daily_report_pipeline_v7.py`
2. Update pipeline to use new specialists
2. Map outputs to Excel generator field expectations
3. Test with 3-job validation run
4. Scale to full 20-job processing

### Phase 3: Validation & Cleanup (FINAL)
1. Verify all Excel fields populated correctly
2. Performance optimization
3. Documentation updates
4. Archive outdated components

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL BLUEPRINT

### Key Components to Replicate from Enhanced Extractor:

#### 1. **ENHANCED_EXTRACTION_PROMPT**
```python
# The exact strategic prompt from skill_extractor_enhanced_v2.py
# 5-bucket categorization: Technical Skills, Domain Expertise, 
# Methodology & Frameworks, Collaboration & Communication, 
# Experience & Qualifications
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Parsing Logic** 
```python
# parse_enhanced_template_response() methodology
# Regex patterns for structured extraction
# Competency levels, experience quantification, criticality scoring
```

#### 3. **Validation Framework**
```python
# validate_enhanced_skill_data() approach
# Error handling and fallback mechanisms
# Data structure validation
```

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Specialist Creation
- [x] Create `requirements_extractor_v1.py`
- [x] Create `skills_categorizer_v1.py` 
- [x] Create `job_analyzer_v1.py`
- [x] Port exact prompts from skill_extractor_enhanced_v2.py
- [x] Implement structured output mapping

### Pipeline Integration  
- [x] Create `daily_report_pipeline_v7.py` (renamed from clean_pipeline_v6.py)
- [x] Update pipeline imports to use new specialists
- [x] Modify `_process_single_job()` method
- [x] Replace `_parse_gemma_requirements()` with JobAnalyzerV1
- [ ] Test integration with 3 jobs
- [ ] Validate Excel output fields

### Validation & Testing
- [ ] All Excel fields populated (no "Not extracted")
- [ ] Performance within acceptable limits
- [ ] Error handling robust
- [ ] Documentation updated

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. **Excel Report Complete:** All fields populated with meaningful data
2. **No "Not extracted" Fields:** Every job has comprehensive extraction
3. **Performance Maintained:** Processing time within current limits
4. **Architecture Clean:** No legacy code, proper versioning
5. **Regression-Proof:** Existing functionality preserved

## üìä TRACKING METRICS

- **Field Completion Rate:** Target 100% (currently ~60%)
- **Processing Success Rate:** Target 100% (currently 67% - 2/3 jobs)
- **Extraction Quality:** Structured, categorized output
- **Integration Stability:** No breaking changes to working components

## üöÄ NEXT ACTIONS

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Create specialists: requirements_extractor_v1.py, skills_categorizer_v1.py, job_analyzer_v1.py
2. **SHORT-TERM:** Integrate specialists into pipeline
3. **VALIDATION:** Test with 3-job run, verify Excel completeness
4. **SCALE:** Full 20-job production run

**Timeline:** Complete within current session  
**Dependencies:** skill_extractor_enhanced_v2.py logic, existing pipeline infrastructure  
**Risk Level:** LOW - Using proven extraction logic from working component
