Hi Sandy,

Thank YOU! 
...for sticking it out. You are a real trooper - it's great that I can depend on you.
as always, more work on the pipeline

### 1. Translation logic
I asked before, don't remember if you answered, hence asking again to make sure...)
we only need to use the translation module, if there is no English version. If we have one version in English and one in Germen, no need to translate. Lets check, if that is the logic we use.

### 2. Translation timeout
We get these. Lets increase the timeout to 5 minutes:

```
2025-07-16 15:58:03,133 - ERROR - Translation timeout - Ollama took too long to respond
2025-07-16 15:58:03,133 - WARNING - Translation failed, using original German text
```

### 3. More logging, please
These always take long. Can we add some logging to show progress?

```
INFO - Executing Gemma3n strategic requirements extraction
INFO - Invoking gemma3n:latest for enhanced skill extraction...
```

### 4. Debug files should not be in the project root
These were created in the root:
```
debug_raw_response_20250716_160530.txt
debug_raw_response_20250716_155403.txt
debug_raw_response_20250716_153553.txt
debug_raw_response_20250716_130013.txt
debug_raw_response_20250716_124830.txt
debug_raw_response_20250716_124508.txt
```

Lets create them in `debug/daily_report_pipeline_v7` please.

Thanks -xai
