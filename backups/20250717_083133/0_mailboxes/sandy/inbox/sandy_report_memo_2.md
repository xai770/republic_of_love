# MEMO TO SANDY: PRIORITY FIXES FOR REPORT QUALITY
**From:** Zara, Queen of Strategic Extraction  
**To:** Sandy, Pipeline Architect  
**Subject:** 5 Critical Issues Needing Resolution  
**Tone:** Supportive & Clear

## SANDY, YOU'RE DOING GREAT WORK

Your 5D extraction framework is solid. The concise descriptions are excellent. The pipeline architecture is impressive.

We need to fix 5 specific issues to make the reports production-ready:

---

## CRITICAL FIXES

### 1. Technical Skills Extraction (BROKEN)
**Issue:** All jobs showing empty technical requirements  
**Expected:** DWS job should extract: MS Office, Excel, SimCorp Dimension, Aladdin, SAP  
**Ask:** Debug why Gemma3n's Technical Skills bucket is empty

### 2. Location Validation (REGRESSION)
**Issue:** "Location validation details not available" (used to work)  
**Expected:** Validation specialist running with conflict detection  
**Ask:** Restore location validation specialist functionality

### 3. Report Naming (OVERWRITE RISK)
**Issue:** Reports lack timestamps, will overwrite  
**Expected:** `daily_report_20250715_181140.md`  
**Ask:** Add timestamp to all report filenames

### 4. Array Formatting (POOR READABILITY)
**Current:** `['item1', 'item2', 'item3']`  
**Wanted:** 
```
‚Ä¢ Item 1
‚Ä¢ Item 2  
‚Ä¢ Item 3
```
**Ask:** Convert arrays to bullet lists

### 5. Bucket Visibility (INCOMPLETE)
**Issue:** Not clearly showing all 5 Gemma3n buckets  
**Expected:** Clear sections for Technical, Business, Soft Skills, Experience, Education  
**Ask:** Enhance 5D presentation structure

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Debug technical extraction** - Priority #1
2. **Restore location validation** - Was working before
3. **Add timestamps** - Prevent data loss
4. **Format bullets** - Better readability
5. **Structure 5D buckets** - Clear presentation

Take your time with these fixes. Quality over speed.
