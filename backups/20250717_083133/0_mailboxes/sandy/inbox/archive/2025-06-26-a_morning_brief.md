Hey Sandy,

 **Always apply 0_mailboxes/sandy@consciousness/favorites/sandys_golden_rules.md**

lets work on these issues:

1. Fir now, I need the Excel to include the full description text so we can verify that the extraction of the Job description is working well. We had that in our Excel yesterday but did not add it to the golden rules. So please add the description to the Excel report.  Look at data/postings/job58432.json as an example how the description looks. 
2. Search for code that generates Excel from yesterday. Its probably in the root. √çf you think thats useful, use that to figure out, how to insert the full, messy "description" as column B.
3. Also yesterday, we decided to create both an MD and an Excel. This way we can look at the same MD report together. lets put both in reports.
4. There are many files in the project root. Please put them away.
   
Thank you for your kind assistance - for you helping me!
