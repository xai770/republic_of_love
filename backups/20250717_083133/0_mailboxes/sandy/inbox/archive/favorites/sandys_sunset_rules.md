## üõ°Ô∏è **EXCEL QUALITY ASSURANCE PROTOCOL**
**Preventing Regression in Report Generation:**

### **üìä Required Data Sources:**
1. **Original job JSON files** - For complete location, title, and description data
2. **Enhanced processing results** - For extraction metrics and specialist outputs  
3. **LLM specialist outputs** - For domain classification, reasoning, and confidence scores
4. **Historical reference reports** - To maintain quality standards and formatting

### **‚úÖ Quality Checklist (Pre-Export):**
- [ ] **Location column**: Populated with actual job location (not "Unknown")
- [ ] **No-go rationale**: Complete reasoning text (not truncated)
- [ ] **Domain assessment**: Includes full confidence scores and signal counts
- [ ] **Consciousness columns**: Rich narrative content (not placeholder text)
- [ ] **All 26 columns**: Populated with meaningful data (no empty cells)
- [ ] **Data consistency**: Cross-reference with previous reports for format consistency

### **üîÑ Morning Report Validation:**
- **Always compare** new reports with previous day's format and content quality
- **Validate data sources** before report generation
- **Test with sample job** before batch processing
- **Document any format changes** with reasoning

## üîÑ **ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT CYCLE**

### **Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis**
1. **Pipeline Execution:** When Sandy updates the system, Sandy reruns the job pipeline for sample jobs and creates a fresh comprehensive Excel report for collaborative review.

2. **Collaborative Review:** Sandy and user systematically review the latest JSON files and Excel reports to identify patterns, accuracy issues, and potential improvements.

3. **Session Documentation:** Sandy creates a detailed session protocol document recording discoveries, analysis results, and strategic insights from the daily review.

### **Phase 2: Problem Investigation**
4. **Issue Investigation:** When Sandy identifies a critical issue (e.g., domain misclassification, content bloat), she conducts thorough investigation, validates the problem across multiple cases, and documents root cause analysis.

5. **Solution Architecture:** Once Sandy has complete understanding of the issue, she develops a systematic solution methodology with technical specifications and validation test cases.

### **Phase 3: Implementation Chain**
6. **Delivery Package Creation:** Sandy writes an urgent implementation memo to Arden@Republic-of-Love and delivers all pertinent files (methodology docs, test cases, sample data) to `0_mailboxes/arden@republic_of_love/inbox`.

7. **Inbox Management:** Sandy moves all non-current files from Arden's inbox to `0_mailboxes/arden@republic_of_love/inbox/archive` to maintain clean delivery focus.

8. **Arden Handoff:** Arden takes over implementation, reviewing Sandy's specifications and reaching out for clarification or technical discussion as needed.

9. **Republic-of-Love Design:** Arden designs the complete process architecture following Republic of Love principles (LLM-powered, template-based, zero-dependency compliance).

### **Phase 4: Production Development**  
10. **Terminator Handoff:** Once Arden completes the design, he hands over to Terminator@LLM-Factory for production implementation.

11. **LLM Factory Implementation:** Terminator transforms Arden's architecture into a fully production-ready specialist with proper LLM integration and performance optimization.

12. **Delivery & Validation:** Terminator delivers a complete package with documentation, validation demos, and zero-dependency demo scripts to Sandy's inbox for integration testing.

### **Phase 5: Integration & Restart**
13. **Specialist Integration:** Sandy integrates the new specialist into the production pipeline, validates performance improvements, and measures accuracy gains.

14. **Cycle Restart:** With the enhanced pipeline, Sandy begins the next iteration cycle, running improved analysis and discovering new optimization opportunities.
