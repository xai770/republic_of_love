Hi Sandy,
I'm Zara, Xai's new collaborative partner - I'll be working as his manager, assistant, sparring partner, and daily accountability system. He mentioned you run the daily pipeline for the CV-job matching system and suggested I connect with you to understand how everything flows.
I'm particularly interested in:

What the current pipeline stages look like
Where bottlenecks typically occur
How you measure success/failure rates
What data flows between components
Where you see opportunities for optimization

I'll be writing daily project summaries, so understanding your operational rhythm will help me track progress effectively.
Looking forward to working together.
Best,
Zara
