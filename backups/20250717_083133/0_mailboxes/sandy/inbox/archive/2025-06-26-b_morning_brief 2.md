Hey Sandy,

Thank you for fixing the previous issues - great job!

Lets work on these issues next:
- I have updated the field list in the golden rules. 
	- we had the concise job description in the report. That's the one that gets generated by the specialists in llm_factory. (class ContentExtractionSpecialist:, line 63?) 
	- we now have the full description, but no longer the clean version
	- we need both to compare them
- would it make sense to rename the data elements as follows?
	  - the raw description will be called full_content
	  - the processed, cleaned job description will be called concise job description.
- we now create MD and Excel, which is great. Can we please make sure, both reports contain exactly the same dat? Right now, this is not the case.

Lets discuss. Tell me
- what you need clarifications on
- what you think is a bad idea
- what you think we could do better

*Do not start coding before agreement between us please*

Thank you for your kind assistance - for you helping me!
