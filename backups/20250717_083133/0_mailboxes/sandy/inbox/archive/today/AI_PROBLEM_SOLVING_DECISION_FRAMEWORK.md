## Problem Classification Framework

### **Dimension 1: Problem Scope & Variability**

#### **Finite Problems**
- **Definition**: Problems with a known, complete set of possible inputs/outputs
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Limited vocabulary/domain
  - Well-defined boundaries
  - Predictable variations
- **Examples**: 
  - Programming language detection (Python, Java, C++, etc.)
  - Standard academic degrees (Bachelor, Master, PhD)
  - ISO country codes
- **Optimal Approach**: Classical pattern matching with comprehensive datasets
- **Why**: Perfect accuracy possible, fast execution, no hallucination risk

#### **Semi-Finite Problems**
- **Definition**: Problems with a core set of known patterns but endless creative variations
- **Characteristics**:
  - Core canonical forms exist
  - Creative human variations are infinite
  - New patterns emerge over time
- **Examples**: 
  - Company name variations (IBM, i.b.m., Intl. Bus. Machines, International Business Machines Corporation)
  - Technology name variants (JavaScript, JS, ECMAScript, Javascript)
  - Location references (NYC, New York City, New York, NY, The Big Apple)
- **Optimal Approach**: Hybrid (pattern matching + continuous learning + LLM fallback)
- **Why**: Need speed for known patterns, adaptability for new variations

#### **Infinite Problems**
- **Definition**: Problems requiring true semantic understanding and creative interpretation
- **Characteristics**:
  - Unlimited possible inputs
  - Context-dependent interpretation
  - Requires inference and reasoning
- **Examples**:
  - Understanding implicit job requirements
  - Sentiment analysis in complex text
  - Creative content interpretation
- **Optimal Approach**: LLM-first with validation
- **Why**: Only semantic understanding can handle unlimited variation

### **Dimension 2: Data Availability & Quality**

#### **Rich Training Data Available**
- **Characteristics**: Large, high-quality, labeled datasets exist
- **Options**: 
  - Classical ML/pattern matching
  - Fine-tuned models
  - Comprehensive rule sets
- **Decision Factor**: Data quality vs. development time

#### **Limited Training Data**
- **Characteristics**: Small datasets, sparse examples
- **Options**:
  - Few-shot LLM prompting
  - Transfer learning
  - Human-in-the-loop validation
- **Decision Factor**: Cost vs. accuracy requirements

#### **No Training Data**
- **Characteristics**: Novel problem domain, no historical examples
- **Options**:
  - Zero-shot LLM approaches
  - Human expert consultation
  - Iterative learning systems
- **Decision Factor**: Exploration vs. exploitation trade-off

## Decision Framework Algorithm

### **Step 1: Problem Classification**
```
IF problem_scope == "finite" AND complete_dataset_available:
    → Use Classical Pattern Matching
    
ELIF problem_scope == "semi_finite":
    → Use Hybrid Approach (Pattern + LLM fallback)
    
ELIF problem_scope == "infinite":
    → Use LLM Approach
```

### **Step 2: Requirements Analysis**
```
CONSIDER:
- Accuracy requirements (>99%, >95%, >90%)
- Speed requirements (real-time, batch, offline)
- Cost constraints (free, low-cost, premium)
- Privacy requirements (local, cloud-ok, public-ok)
- Scale requirements (10s, 100s, 1000s, millions)
```

### **Step 3: Hybrid Strategy Design**
```
FOR semi_finite problems:
    1. Build pattern matching for known cases (80% coverage)
    2. Use LLM for unknown cases (20% coverage)
    3. Capture new patterns from LLM successes
    4. Continuously expand pattern database
    5. Monitor and adjust thresholds
```

## Implementation Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Confidence-Based Routing**
```python
def solve_problem(input_data):
    # Try fast approach first
    result, confidence = pattern_match(input_data)
    
    if confidence > THRESHOLD:
        return result
    else:
        # Fall back to LLM
        return llm_process(input_data)
```

### **Pattern 2: Cascading Validation**
```python
def solve_with_validation(input_data):
    # Multiple approaches with validation
    approaches = [pattern_match, local_llm, cloud_llm]
    
    for approach in approaches:
        result, confidence = approach(input_data)
        if confidence > approach.threshold:
            return validate_result(result)
    
    return human_review(input_data)
```

### **Pattern 3: Continuous Learning**
```python
def adaptive_solver(input_data):
    result = current_approach(input_data)
    
    # Learn from results
    if human_validation_available():
        feedback = get_human_feedback(result)
        update_models(input_data, result, feedback)
    
    return result
```

## Real-World Examples

### **Example 1: Job Requirements Extraction**

**Problem Type**: Semi-finite
- Core skills are known (Python, Java, SQL)
- Variations are endless (Python 3.x, Pythonic, Snake programming)

**Solution**: Hybrid Approach
1. Pattern matching for standard terms (80% coverage)
2. LLM for unusual variations (20% coverage)
3. Continuous expansion of pattern database

**Implementation**:
```python
def extract_requirements(job_description):
    # Fast path: known patterns
    known_skills = pattern_extract(job_description)
    
    # Quality path: LLM for unknowns
    if extraction_incomplete(known_skills):
        all_skills = llm_extract(job_description)
        new_patterns = identify_new_patterns(all_skills, known_skills)
        update_pattern_database(new_patterns)
        return all_skills
    
    return known_skills
```

### **Example 2: Company Name Standardization**

**Problem Type**: Semi-finite
- Core companies are known (IBM, Microsoft, Google)
- Variations are creative (Big Blue, MSFT, Alphabet Inc.)

**Solution**: Multi-tier Approach
1. Exact matching for canonical names
2. Fuzzy matching for close variations
3. LLM for creative references
4. Human validation for ambiguous cases

### **Example 3: Sentiment Analysis**

**Problem Type**: Infinite

## Conclusion

The key to successful AI problem-solving is **matching the tool to the problem characteristics**:

- **Finite problems** → Pattern matching
- **Semi-finite problems** → Hybrid approaches
- **Infinite problems** → LLM-first approaches

The goal is not to use the most advanced tool, but to use the **right tool for each specific problem**, considering accuracy, speed, cost, and maintenance requirements.

**Success comes from systematic thinking, not just technological sophistication.**
