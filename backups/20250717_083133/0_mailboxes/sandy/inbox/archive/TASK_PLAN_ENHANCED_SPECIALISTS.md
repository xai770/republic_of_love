  - Compare with your existing `daily_report_pipeline/specialists/consciousness_first_specialists.py`
  - Identify key improvements and bug fixes

- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Backup existing specialist
  - Create backup of current consciousness specialist
  - Save as `consciousness_first_specialists_backup.py`

- [ ] **Task 1.3:** Integrate enhanced methods
  - Copy `_calculate_match_scores_llm_enhanced` method improvements
  - Update error handling in calculation methods
  - Preserve your existing initialization and configuration

- [ ] **Task 1.4:** Update import references
  - Verify all imports still resolve correctly
  - Update any class references if needed

- [ ] **Task 1.5:** Initial validation
  - Run basic import test to ensure no syntax errors
  - Test with sample job description to verify calculations work

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Enhanced specialist loads without errors
- [ ] Zero-score calculations now return meaningful values
- [ ] Existing functionality preserved
- [ ] No import or syntax errors

### **Validation Method:**
```python
# Test script to validate Stage 1
from daily_report_pipeline.specialists.consciousness_first_specialists import ConsciousnessFirstSpecialistManager
specialist = ConsciousnessFirstSpecialistManager()
test_result = specialist._calculate_match_scores_llm_enhanced("test job description", {})
assert test_result is not None and any(score > 0 for score in test_result.values())
```

### **Files to Modify:**
- `daily_report_pipeline/specialists/consciousness_first_specialists.py` - Integrate enhanced methods

### **Expected Outcome:**
Consciousness specialist calculations produce meaningful scores instead of zeros, with robust error handling.

  - Examine `/home/xai/Documents/republic_of_love/strategic_requirements_specialist.py`
  - Understand strategic analysis capabilities
  - Review output format and integration points

- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Add to specialists directory
  - Copy `strategic_requirements_specialist.py` to your specialists directory
  - Ensure proper file permissions and location

- [ ] **Task 2.3:** Update specialists __init__.py
  - Add import for `StrategicRequirementsSpecialist`
  - Include in __all__ list if present

- [ ] **Task 2.4:** Integrate into pipeline
  - Add strategic specialist initialization to your pipeline runner
  - Configure processing flow to include strategic analysis
  - Ensure output is captured and used appropriately

- [ ] **Task 2.5:** Test strategic analysis
  - Test with Deutsche Bank consulting job description
  - Verify strategic elements are detected correctly
  - Validate output format matches expectations

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Strategic specialist loads and initializes correctly
- [ ] Strategic analysis produces relevant insights for consulting jobs
- [ ] Integration with existing pipeline flows properly
- [ ] Output format is suitable for downstream processing

### **Validation Method:**
```python
# Test script to validate Stage 2
from daily_report_pipeline.specialists.strategic_requirements_specialist import StrategicRequirementsSpecialist
specialist = StrategicRequirementsSpecialist()
test_job = "Senior Consultant (d/m/w) â€“ Deutsche Bank Management Consulting..."
result = specialist.extract_strategic_requirements(test_job)
assert 'strategic_elements' in result and len(result['strategic_elements']) > 0
```

### **Files to Modify:**
- `daily_report_pipeline/specialists/strategic_requirements_specialist.py` - Add new file
- `daily_report_pipeline/specialists/__init__.py` - Add import
- Your pipeline runner - Add initialization and integration

### **Expected Outcome:**
Strategic requirements analysis available for consulting positions, providing organizational fit insights.

## ðŸ“‹ **STAGE 3: ENHANCED FALLBACK LOGIC**

### **Objective:**
Implement job-specific fallback logic to eliminate generic template responses and generate meaningful content.

### **Tasks:**
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Locate fallback methods
  - Find rationale generation methods in your pipeline
  - Identify narrative creation logic
  - Review current template fallback implementation

- [ ] **Task 3.2:** Implement enhanced rationale method
  - Add `_get_specific_rationale_or_partial` method to your pipeline
  - Integrate consciousness specialist for enhanced scoring
  - Include strategic specialist for consulting insights
  - Add job-specific term extraction as final fallback

- [ ] **Task 3.3:** Implement enhanced narrative method
  - Add `_get_specific_narrative_or_partial` method
  - Use strategic analysis for narrative context
  - Generate job-specific professional positioning advice

- [ ] **Task 3.4:** Update existing fallback calls
  - Replace generic template calls with enhanced methods
  - Ensure parameters are passed correctly
  - Maintain existing error handling structure

- [ ] **Task 3.5:** Test fallback logic
  - Test with various job types to ensure appropriate responses
  - Verify no generic templates are returned
  - Validate error conditions still handled gracefully

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Generic template responses eliminated
- [ ] Job-specific content generated for all job types
- [ ] Fallback logic handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

### **Validation Method:**
```python
# Test script to validate Stage 3
# Process sample job and verify output specificity
output = pipeline._get_specific_rationale_or_partial({}, {}, test_job_description)
assert "Decision analysis required" not in output
assert len(output) > 50  # Should be substantial content
```

### **Files to Modify:**
- Your pipeline runner - Add enhanced fallback methods and update calls

### **Expected Outcome:**
All pipeline outputs contain job-specific content instead of generic templates, improving recommendation quality.
