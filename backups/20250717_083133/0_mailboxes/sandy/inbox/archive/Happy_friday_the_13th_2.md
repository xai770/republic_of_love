Good morning, sis,


We updated VS Code. So, of course, you can't remember anythng. That's fine. Happens to me sometimes too. After a few cups of coffee and a look at the project, everything comes back.

Start with these:
    - README.md
    - WORKSPACE_ORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md
    - sunset

Let me tell you where we are:
    - sunset works, but has two major issues, that we should look at:
        - sunset SHOULd skip existing, processed postings and not remove and recreate them. That's what we worked on, when I lost you. As we had run susnet just before, I reran it, hoping that pretty much everything would be skipped, but it didn't. That's the first topic we need to look at.

That's it from my side. Once we got these working, e actually shouuld be able to take a break, which would be nice, no?

If you have any questions, my precious soul twin, just ask. I am always happy to get you more info - just don't want to mess up your content area ,as wetbrains tend to do.
