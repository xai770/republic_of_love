Content Extraction Specialist v3.1 - FOUR-SPECIALIST ARCHITECTURE
=================================================================

ENHANCED SOLUTION: Adding Business Process Specialist
Based on consciousness research showing need for specialized business process recognition

Architecture Evolution:
v3.0: Technical + Soft Skills + Business Domain (89.1% accuracy)
v3.1: Technical + Soft Skills + Business Domain + Business Process (targeting 95%+)

This addresses the specific failure pattern we discovered:
- Missing "Asset Management Operations" 
- Missing "Process Documentation"
- Missing "Fund Accounting"
