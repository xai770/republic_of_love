# 5D Extraction Enhancement - Task Plan
## Stage-by-Stage Implementation Tasks for Sandy

**Project:** Deutsche Bank 5D Requirements Extraction  
**Created:** July 11, 2025  
**Total Stages:** 4  
**Current Stage:** 1 (Primary 5D Integration)  

---

## üìã **STAGE 1: PRIMARY 5D INTEGRATION** ‚≠ê *[CURRENT STAGE]*

### **Objective:**
Replace the fragmented extraction approach with your unified EnhancedRequirementsExtractor as the primary system.

### **Background:**
Currently `run_pipeline_v2.py` uses TechnicalExtractionSpecialistV33 as primary and EnhancedRequirementsExtractor only as fallback for experience/education. We need to flip this to use the comprehensive 5D system as primary.

### **Tasks:**
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Locate the `_extract_and_format_requirements_with_specialist()` method in `run_pipeline_v2.py` (around line 440)
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Replace the current fragmented approach with primary EnhancedRequirementsExtractor call
- [x] **Task 1.3**: Keep TechnicalExtractionSpecialistV33 as supplementary for SAP-specific technical skills
- [x] **Task 1.4**: Ensure proper error handling and fallback mechanisms remain
- [x] **Task 1.5**: Update the method to properly format the complete 5D output for RequirementsDisplaySpecialist

### **Specific Code Changes:**

#### **Current Logic (around line 440 in run_pipeline_v2.py):**
```python
# STEP 1: Extract using WORKING v3.3 technical extraction specialist
technical_result = self.technical_extraction_specialist_v33.extract_technical_requirements_corrected(...)

# STEP 2: Build compatible format for requirements display specialist  
requirements_5d = {
    'technical': technical_result.technical_skills,
    'domain': technical_result.business_skills,
    'soft_skills': technical_result.soft_skills,
    'experience': [],  # Will be handled by existing v3 extractor as fallback
    'education': []    # Will be handled by existing v3 extractor as fallback
}

# STEP 3: Get experience and education from existing extractor (these work fine)
try:
    fallback_requirements = self.enhanced_requirements_extractor_v3.extract_requirements(job_description)
    requirements_5d['experience'] = fallback_requirements.experience
    requirements_5d['education'] = fallback_requirements.education
```

#### **New Logic (what to change it to):**
```python
# STEP 1: Extract using PRIMARY enhanced 5D requirements extractor
primary_requirements = self.enhanced_requirements_extractor_v3.extract_requirements(job_description)

# STEP 2: Get supplementary SAP technical skills if needed
try:
    sap_supplement = self.technical_extraction_specialist_v33.extract_technical_requirements_corrected(...)
    # Merge SAP technical skills with primary technical extraction
    enhanced_technical = list(set(primary_requirements.technical + sap_supplement.technical_skills))
except Exception as e:
    enhanced_technical = primary_requirements.technical
    
# STEP 3: Build complete 5D format
requirements_5d = {
    'technical': enhanced_technical,
    'domain': primary_requirements.business,
    'soft_skills': primary_requirements.soft_skills,
    'experience': primary_requirements.experience,
    'education': primary_requirements.education
}
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- [x] **SC 1.1**: Daily report shows real experience requirements (not "Experience requirements analysis needed")
- [x] **SC 1.2**: Daily report shows real education requirements (not "Education requirements analysis needed")  
- [x] **SC 1.3**: Technical extraction quality maintained or improved
- [x] **SC 1.4**: No errors in pipeline execution
- [x] **SC 1.5**: All 5 dimensions populated with structured data

### **Validation Method:**
```bash
# Run pipeline with test data
cd /path/to/sandy/daily_report_pipeline
python run_pipeline_v2.py --test-mode

# Check that all 5D fields are populated in output
grep -A 20 "5D Requirements" reports/test_output.md

# Verify no placeholders remain
grep "analysis needed" reports/test_output.md  # Should return no results
```

### **Files to Modify:**
- `daily_report_pipeline/run_pipeline_v2.py` - Main pipeline logic (around line 440)

### **Expected Outcome:**
After Stage 1, your daily reports should show **complete 5D extraction** with real data in all dimensions, eliminating the placeholder messages for experience and education.

## üìã **STAGE 2: GERMAN LANGUAGE ENHANCEMENT** *[NEXT STAGE]*

### **Objective:**
Enhance German language processing patterns in your EnhancedRequirementsExtractor to better handle Deutsche Bank's German job descriptions.

### **Preview Tasks:**
- [ ] **Task 2.1**: Expand German soft skills patterns in `enhanced_requirements_extraction.py`
- [ ] **Task 2.2**: Add German experience terminology patterns
- [ ] **Task 2.3**: Enhance German education system terminology
- [ ] **Task 2.4**: Add German technical terminology for banking/SAP
- [ ] **Task 2.5**: Test with German job descriptions

### **Preview Success Criteria:**
- [ ] German compound words extracted ("Kundenorientierung", "L√∂sungsorientierung")
- [ ] German experience patterns recognized ("fundierte Berufserfahrung")
- [ ] German education terms processed ("Hochschule", "Schwerpunkt")

*Detailed Stage 2 instructions will be provided after Stage 1 completion and review.*

---

## üìã **STAGE 3: BANKING DOMAIN SPECIALIZATION** *[FUTURE STAGE]*

### **Objective:**
Add Deutsche Bank and financial services specific terminology and patterns.

### **Preview Focus:**
- Banking business requirements ("Finanz-Konsolidierung", "ESG Target Reporting")
- Financial compliance terminology ("ITAO", "Audit", "regulatorische Standards")
- SAP Financial products ("SAP PaPM", "BW/4HANA", "DataSphere")

---

## üìã **STAGE 4: INTEGRATION TESTING & VALIDATION** *[FINAL STAGE]*

### **Objective:**
Comprehensive testing and validation of the complete enhanced 5D system.

### **Preview Focus:**
- End-to-end testing with Deutsche Bank jobs
- Performance measurement vs. baseline
- Final accuracy validation
