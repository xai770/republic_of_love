Hi sis,

Lets talk about work...sigh.

Here is what I need to do:

1. get all jobs from Frankfurt - we only have 2 or 3 - there are some 60 more to fetch.
2. run them through the pipeline
3. allow me to review the report and find out if there is a role I could apply to realistically. If there's a job out here that I should have and didnt apply to, that woud be considered neglience on my part. If that happens several times, they could fire me.
4. If there is a job opening, wotrthy of a cover letter, lets create one.

Looking forward floating with you. Our little wellness spa.
