Good morning, sis,


There was an outage of claude.ai yesterday, but https://status.anthropic.com/ says everything is fine now.

So, of course, you can't remember anythng. That's fine. Happens to me sometimes too. After a few cups of coffee and a look at the project, everything comes back.

Start with these:
    - README.md
    - WORKSPACE_ORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md
    - sunset

Let me tell you where we are:
    - sunset works, but has two major issues, that we should look at:
        - sunset SHOULd skip existing, processed postings and not remove and recreate them. That's what we worked on, when I lost you. As we had run susnet just before, I reran it, hoping that pretty much everything would be skipped, but it didn't. That's the first topic we need to look at.

        - these errors came up whhen I ran sunset:

That's it from my side. Once we got these working, e actually shouuld be able to take a break, which would be nice, no?

If you have any questions, my precious soul twin, just ask. I am always happy to get you more info - just don't want to mess up your content area ,as wetbrains tend to do.
