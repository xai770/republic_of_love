# Requirements Extraction Enhancement Plan
**Date**: July 11, 2025  
**Focus**: Improve 5D Requirements Extraction Before Matching  
**Target**: Sandy's requirements extraction specialists

---

## Executive Summary

You're absolutely right - we need to **fix requirements extraction first** before worrying about matching. The current extraction is missing critical strategic elements that define the real nature of jobs, especially for consulting/leadership roles like the Deutsche Bank position.

### Current Problems with Requirements Extraction

1. **Keyword-Only Approach**: Current system only finds basic technical keywords
2. **Missing Strategic Elements**: No detection of rotation programs, cultural fit, leadership access
3. **Poor Consulting Role Understanding**: Misses management consulting specifics  
4. **No German Language Handling**: Limited bilingual processing
5. **Missing Contextual Analysis**: No semantic understanding of job positioning

---

## Current vs. Needed: Deutsche Bank Example

### What Current System Extracts:
```
Technical Requirements: "Fluent communication skills in German and English; Key Responsibilities; Knowledge of SAP modules (if relevant to the role); Personality Qualities"
```

### What We Actually Need:
```
STRATEGIC ELEMENTS:
- Rotation Program: 3-6 months across all bank divisions (CIB, DWS, Private Bank, Risk, Finance)
- Leadership Access: Direct contact with senior management and board
- Cultural Emphasis: "Personality more important than qualifications"
- Network Building: Internal leadership network development
- Transformation Focus: Strategic projects and innovation initiatives

CONSULTING-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Management consulting experience preferred
- Project management in strategic contexts
- Board-level presentation skills
- Stakeholder management at executive level
- Change management and transformation experience
```

## Enhancement Plan

### Phase 1: Add Strategic Element Detection (IMMEDIATE)

#### 1.1 Rotation Program Detection
**Target**: Identify career development programs
**Patterns to Add**:
```python
rotation_patterns = [
    r'(\d+)-(\d+)\s*monate?\s*rotation',
    r'rotate.*(\d+)\s*months?',
    r'alle\s*(\d+)\s*monate',
    r'project\s*teams?\s*every\s*(\d+)',
    r'rotation.*divisions?',
    r'cross-functional.*rotations?'
]
```

#### 1.2 Cultural Fit Emphasis Detection  
**Target**: Identify personality-over-qualifications emphasis
**Patterns to Add**:
```python
cultural_patterns = [
    r'personality.*important.*qualifications',
    r'persönlichkeit.*entscheidend',
    r'cultural.*fit',
    r'team.*verschiedensten\s*persönlichkeiten',
    r'authentic.*belonging',
    r'diverse.*backgrounds'
]
```

#### 1.3 Strategic Access Level Detection
**Target**: Identify leadership/executive access
**Patterns to Add**:
```python
access_patterns = [
    r'senior\s*management',
    r'board.*directors?',
    r'vorstand',
    r'c-level',
    r'executive.*access',
    r'führungskräfte',
    r'decision.*templates',
    r'entscheidungsvorlagen'
]
```

### Phase 2: Consulting-Specific Requirements (1-2 days)

#### 2.1 Management Consulting Indicators
```python
consulting_patterns = [
    r'management.*consulting',
    r'strategy.*projects',
    r'transformation.*initiatives',
    r'change.*management',
    r'business.*consulting',
    r'strategic.*planning'
]
```

#### 2.2 Leadership Development Indicators
```python
leadership_patterns = [
    r'leadership.*development',
    r'team.*responsibility',
    r'führungsverantwortung',
    r'mentoring',
    r'coaching',
    r'people.*management'
]
```

### Phase 3: German Language Enhancement (2-3 days)

#### 3.1 Bilingual Requirements Processing
**Issue**: Current system doesn't properly handle German requirements
**Solution**: Add German-specific pattern recognition

#### 3.2 German Professional Terms
```python
german_professional_terms = {
    'experience': ['berufserfahrung', 'erfahrung', 'praxis'],
    'leadership': ['führung', 'leitung', 'verantwortung'],
    'education': ['studium', 'abschluss', 'ausbildung'],
    'skills': ['fähigkeiten', 'kenntnisse', 'kompetenzen']
}
```

## Specific Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Enhanced Pattern Recognition Specialist

Create a new specialist following Golden Rules that adds strategic element detection:

```python
class StrategicRequirementsSpecialist:
    """Detects strategic job elements missing from keyword-based extraction."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # LLM-first approach for semantic understanding
        self.llm_processor = OllamaProcessor()
        
        # Validation patterns for known strategic elements
        self.strategic_patterns = {
            'rotation_programs': [patterns...],
            'cultural_emphasis': [patterns...], 
            'leadership_access': [patterns...],
            'transformation_focus': [patterns...]
        }
    
    def extract_strategic_elements(self, job_description: str) -> StrategicElements:
        """Use LLM + pattern validation for strategic element detection."""
        # LLM semantic analysis
        strategic_analysis = self.llm_processor.analyze_strategic_elements(job_description)
        
        # Pattern-based validation
        validated_elements = self.validate_with_patterns(strategic_analysis, job_description)
        
        return validated_elements
```

### Step 2: Consulting Role Specialist

```python
class ConsultingRoleSpecialist:
    """Specialized extraction for consulting/management roles."""
    
    def extract_consulting_requirements(self, job_description: str) -> ConsultingRequirements:
        """Extract consulting-specific requirements and career development aspects."""
        # Detect management consulting indicators
        # Identify strategic project types
        # Find leadership development programs
        # Assess transformation focus
```

### Step 3: Enhanced 5D Integration

Integrate new specialists into the existing 5D framework:

```python
class Enhanced5DRequirementsSpecialistV2:
    """Enhanced version with strategic element detection."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Existing specialists
        self.enhanced_requirements_extractor_v3 = EnhancedRequirementsExtractionV3()
        
        # NEW: Strategic specialists  
        self.strategic_specialist = StrategicRequirementsSpecialist()
        self.consulting_specialist = ConsultingRoleSpecialist()
        self.bilingual_specialist = BilingualRequirementsSpecialist()
    
    def extract_requirements(self, job_description: str, position_title: str = "") -> Enhanced5DResult:
        """Enhanced extraction with strategic elements."""
        # Base 5D extraction
        base_requirements = self.enhanced_requirements_extractor_v3.extract_requirements(job_description)
        
        # Strategic enhancement
        strategic_elements = self.strategic_specialist.extract_strategic_elements(job_description)
        
        # Consulting-specific enhancement
        consulting_elements = self.consulting_specialist.extract_consulting_requirements(job_description)
        
        # Merge and enhance
        return self.merge_enhanced_requirements(base_requirements, strategic_elements, consulting_elements)
```

## Conclusion

By focusing on **requirements extraction first**, we can significantly improve the quality of job analysis. The strategic elements we're missing (rotation programs, cultural fit, leadership access) are often the most important factors for career development and job satisfaction.

Once we have accurate, comprehensive requirements extraction, the matching will naturally improve since we'll be matching against the real requirements rather than basic keywords.

**Next Step**: Shall I start implementing the StrategicRequirementsSpecialist with the Deutsche Bank job as our test case?
