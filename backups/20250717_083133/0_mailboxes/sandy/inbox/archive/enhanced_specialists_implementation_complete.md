## 🚀 Implementation Summary

### ✅ **Critical Bugs Fixed**

1. **Zero Score Bug RESOLVED** ❌➡️✅
   - **Issue**: `consciousness_first_specialists.py` missing "experience" and "education" dimensions
   - **Solution**: Created `consciousness_first_specialists_fixed.py` with proper 5D scoring
   - **Result**: All dimensions now properly calculated (technical, business, soft_skills, experience, education)

2. **Hardcoded Scoring REPLACED** ❌➡️✅
   - **Issue**: Placeholder method returning same scores for all jobs
   - **Solution**: Implemented LLM-enhanced scoring with Ollama integration
   - **Result**: Actual job-CV matching now occurs

3. **Strategic Elements ADDED** ⚠️➡️✅
   - **Issue**: Missing rotation programs, cultural fit, leadership access detection
   - **Solution**: Created `strategic_requirements_specialist.py` with dual-model strategy
   - **Result**: Deutsche Bank-style strategic elements now captured
