Content Extraction Specialist v3.3 - PRODUCTION FIXED v2
========================================================

CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX v2: Ultra-focused extraction only from input text
Root cause identified: LLM was generating skills from training examples, not input text

Key Fixes:
- Stricter prompts that ONLY look at the provided text
- Explicit instruction to ignore training examples
- Better input/output separation
- Robust parsing that still prevents empty results

Target: 90%+ accuracy, 100% format compliance, no hallucination

Date: June 27, 2025
Status: PRODUCTION-READY FIXED VERSION v2
