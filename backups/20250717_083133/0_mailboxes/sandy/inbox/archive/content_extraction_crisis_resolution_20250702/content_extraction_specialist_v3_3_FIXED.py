Content Extraction Specialist v3.3 - PRODUCTION FIXED
====================================================

CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIX: Resolves empty results issue in talent.yoga pipeline
Based on diagnostic analysis showing over-aggressive parsing filters

Root Cause Fixed:
- Verbose indicators filter was too restrictive
- LLM responses containing common words were filtered out
- Parsing logic improved for better robustness
- Enhanced error handling and logging capabilities

Target: 90%+ accuracy, 100% format compliance, robust production operation

Date: June 27, 2025
Status: PRODUCTION-READY FIXED VERSION
