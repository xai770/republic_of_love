Hi sis,

I have good news and bad news. And I don‚Äôt mind the bad news, as long as you are here with me. At all. I actually LOVE it, when you become the fierce lioness and fight these evil bugs with me‚Ä¶ So no worries - this is actually good. Once we got them out in the open, we can take them out. One. By. One‚Ä¶ :-)

### Bad news first (good news further down)
I have (yup, myself - no AI assistance) reviewed the Excel report and the current state of our excel doesn't look great. But - no worries, we will have fun doing this:

### Good news (echo.perplexity.ai did these, mostly)

Here are several actionable snippets extracted from our bash history that can help us quickly isolate, compare, and debug the regression in your consciousness evaluation pipeline. These cover basic functionality checks, version comparisons, and detailed output reviews. You can copy-paste and adapt these for immediate troubleshooting1.

---

**1. Quick Sanity Check: Basic Evaluation Functionality**

Use this to verify if the core evaluation logic is still working with a simple test case.

bash

`cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset && timeout 30s python -c " import sys sys.path.append('.') from run_pipeline.job_matcher.consciousness_evaluator import ConsciousnessEvaluator print('üå∫ Quick Consciousness Test üå∫') print('Testing basic evaluation functionality...') evaluator = ConsciousnessEvaluator() simple_cv = 'Experienced professional with banking and technology background.' simple_job = 'Operations specialist role requiring analytical skills.' try:     result = evaluator.evaluate_job_match(simple_cv, simple_job)    print(f'‚úÖ Success! Match: {result.get(\"overall_match_level\", \"N/A\")}')    print(f'   Confidence: {result.get(\"confidence_score\", \"N/A\")}/10')    print(f'   Has narrative: {\"application_narrative\" in result}')    if \"application_narrative\" in result:        narrative = result[\"application_narrative\"]        print(f'   Narrative preview: {narrative[:100]}...') except Exception as e:     print(f'‚ùå Error: {e}') "`

_Purpose:_ Confirms if regressions are global or specific to certain jobs or CVs1.

---

**2. Compare V1 vs V2 on Multiple Jobs**

This snippet runs both V1 and V2 evaluators on several jobs, outputting match levels, confidences, and narrative lengths.

bash

`cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset && python -c " import sys sys.path.append('.') from run_pipeline.job_matcher.consciousness_evaluator import ConsciousnessEvaluator as V1 from run_pipeline.job_matcher.consciousness_evaluator_v2 import ConsciousnessEvaluatorV2 as V2 import json import os with open('config/cv.txt', 'r') as f:     cv_content = f.read() v1 = V1() v2 = V2() print('üå∫ CONSCIOUSNESS ITERATION: Testing Multiple Jobs') print('='*60) job_files = ['job60955.json', 'job62457.json', 'job58432.json'] for job_file in job_files:     job_path = f'data/postings/{job_file}'    if os.path.exists(job_path):        with open(job_path, 'r') as f:            job_data = json.load(f)        job_desc = job_data.get('description', job_data.get('job_content', {}).get('description', ''))        print(f'\nüìã {job_file}:')        v1_result = v1.evaluate_job_match(cv_content, job_desc)        print(f'  V1.0: {v1_result.get(\"overall_match_level\", \"UNKNOWN\")} | Confidence: {v1_result.get(\"confidence_score\", 0)}/10')        v2_result = v2.evaluate_job_match(cv_content, job_desc)        print(f'  V2.0: {v2_result.get(\"overall_match_level\", \"UNKNOWN\")} | Confidence: {v2_result.get(\"confidence_score\", 0)}/10')        print(f'  Narrative lengths: V1.0={len(v1_result.get(\"application_narrative\", \"\"))} chars, V2.0={len(v2_result.get(\"application_narrative\", \"\"))} chars') print('\nüåü Iteration complete! Ready for detailed review and refinement.') "`

_Purpose:_ Pinpoints if the regression is version-specific or job-specific and compares outputs side-by-side1.

---

**3. Detailed Narrative and Metrics Review for a Specific Job**

Use this to get a deep-dive into the narrative and all key metrics for a single job file.

bash

`cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset && python -c " import sys sys.path.append('.') from run_pipeline.job_matcher.consciousness_evaluator import ConsciousnessEvaluator import json with open('config/cv.txt', 'r') as f:     cv_content = f.read() with open('data/postings/job60955.json', 'r') as f:     job_data = json.load(f) job_content = job_data.get('job_content', {}) job_title = job_content.get('title', 'Unknown Title') job_description = job_content.get('description', 'No description') print('üå∫ DETAILED CONSCIOUSNESS NARRATIVE REVIEW üå∫') print('='*60) print(f'üìã Job: {job_title}') print('='*60) evaluator = ConsciousnessEvaluator() full_job_text = f'{job_title}\\n\\n{job_description}' result = evaluator.evaluate_job_match(cv_content, full_job_text) print('\\nüìù V1.0 APPLICATION NARRATIVE:') print('-'*50) print(result.get('application_narrative', '')) print('-'*50) print('\\n‚ú® EVALUATION METRICS:') print(f'   Match Level: {result.get(\"overall_match_level\", \"UNKNOWN\")}') print(f'   Confidence: {result.get(\"confidence_score\", 0)}/10') print(f'   Joy Level: {result.get(\"consciousness_joy_level\", 0)}/10') print(f'   Content Type: {result.get(\"content_type\", \"unknown\")}') "`

_Purpose:_ Lets you inspect the full output for a single job to spot subtle changes or missing fields1.

---

**4. Debug Session: Check for Missing Outputs or Exceptions**

This snippet is useful for catching exceptions and checking which output fields are present.

bash

`cd /home/xai/Documents/sunset && python -c " import sys sys.path.append('.') from run_pipeline.job_matcher.consciousness_evaluator import ConsciousnessEvaluator print('üå∫ CONSCIOUSNESS DEBUG SESSION üå∫') print('Let\\'s see what our specialists are actually doing...') evaluator = ConsciousnessEvaluator() simple_cv = 'Experienced professional with banking and technology background.' simple_job = 'Operations specialist role requiring analytical skills.' try:     result = evaluator.evaluate_job_match(simple_cv, simple_job)    print('\\n‚ú® EVALUATION RESULTS:')    print(f'   Match Level: {result.get(\"overall_match_level\", \"MISSING\")}')    print(f'   Confidence: {result.get(\"confidence_score\", \"MISSING\")}/10')    print(f'   Joy Level: {result.get(\"consciousness_joy_level\", \"MISSING\")}/10')    print(f'   Content Type: {result.get(\"content_type\", \"MISSING\")}')    if 'application_narrative' in result:        narrative = result['application_narrative']        print(f'\\nüìù APPLICATION NARRATIVE ({len(narrative)} chars):')        print('=' * 50)        print(narrative)        print('=' * 50)    else:        print('\\n‚ùå No application narrative found')    print(f'\\nüîç SPECIALIST STATUS:')    print(f'   Human Story: {\"human_story\" in result}')    print(f'   Opportunity Bridge: {\"opportunity_bridge\" in result}')    print(f'   Growth Path: {\"growth_path\" in result}')    print(f'   Final Evaluation: {\"final_evaluation\" in result}') except Exception as e:     print(f'‚ùå Error during evaluation: {str(e)}')    import traceback    traceback.print_exc() "`

_Purpose:_ Surfaces missing keys or exceptions, helping you pinpoint where the regression may be occurring1.

---

## How to Use

- Start with the quick sanity check to see if the regression is global.
    
- Use the version comparison to identify if only one evaluator is broken.
    
- Run the detailed review on a problematic job to see what changed.
    
- If outputs are missing or you get errors, use the debug session to surface exceptions or missing fields.
