# Location Validation Specialist LLM Delivery

## Overview
This is the production-ready Location Validation Specialist for your Daily Report Pipeline, fully compliant with `republic_of_love_rules.md` and all escalation requirements.

- 100% LLM-powered (Ollama, llama3.2:latest)
- Strict template-based output, no JSON or extra text
- Zero-dependency test script for edge-case validation
- Handles all known edge cases: city/country/borough ambiguity, context bleeding, "same city, different country"

## Files Delivered
- `location_validation_specialist_llm.py` (specialist code)
- `test_hallucination_detection.py` (zero-dependency test script)
- `location_validation_specialist_llm_README.md` (this doc)

## How to Use
1. Start Ollama with the llama3.2:latest model.
2. Run `python test_hallucination_detection.py`.
3. All tests should pass (no hallucinations or logic errors).

## What Changed
- The LLM prompt is now extremely strict: only the template is output, boroughs are handled as part of cities, and "same city, different country" is always flagged as a conflict.
- All advanced edge-case tests now pass.

## Compliance
- LLM-only logic (Rule 1)
- Template output (Rule 2)
- Zero-dependency test (Rule 3)
- Full documentation and test script delivered (Rule 4)
