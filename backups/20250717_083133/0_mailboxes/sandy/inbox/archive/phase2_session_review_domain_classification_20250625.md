# Phase 2 Session Review: Domain Classification Investigation üîçüéØ

**Session Date**: June 25, 2025  
**Phase**: 2 - Domain Classification Deep Dive  
**Previous Success**: Content Extraction Specialist (84.1% average reduction achieved)  
**Current Focus**: Deutsche Bank Associate domain misclassification analysis  

## üéØ INVESTIGATION SCOPE

### Primary Question
Why is Deutsche Bank Associate (Job 50571) being classified as "banking_sales" instead of "management_consulting"?

### Hypothesis
Even with our newly cleaned content (89.6% reduction achieved), the domain classification boundaries may need refinement for management consulting vs. traditional banking roles.

## üìä BASELINE DATA (Content Extraction Success)

### Job 50571 - Deutsche Bank Associate Details
- **Original Content**: 9,508 characters (bloated)  
- **Cleaned Content**: 987 characters (clean, domain-signal focused)  
- **Reduction**: 89.6% ‚úÖ  
- **Current Classification**: "banking_sales"  
- **Expected Classification**: "management_consulting"  

### Clean Content Sample (Post-Extraction)
```
Position: Associate, Deutsche Bank Group
Requirements: Management consulting experience, strategic analysis, client relationship management
Skills: Financial modeling, project management, stakeholder engagement
[Domain signals preserved, bloat removed]
```

## üî¨ INVESTIGATION APPROACH

### Phase 2.1: Domain Classification Analysis
1. **Examine Current Logic**: Review domain classification algorithms
2. **Boundary Analysis**: Understand management_consulting vs banking_sales boundaries  
3. **Signal Mapping**: Identify which keywords/phrases drive classification
4. **Clean Content Testing**: Run Job 50571 clean content through classifier

### Phase 2.2: Classification Refinement
1. **Rule Enhancement**: Improve domain classification boundaries
2. **Signal Weighting**: Adjust importance of management consulting indicators
3. **Validation Testing**: Test across all 5 jobs with clean content
4. **Performance Measurement**: Compare before/after classification accuracy

### Phase 2.3: Integration & Validation  
1. **Pipeline Integration**: Enhanced classification with content extraction
2. **Excel Reporting**: Updated validation reports with new classifications
3. **Documentation**: Complete investigation findings and improvements

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL INVESTIGATION PLAN

### Step 1: Locate Classification Logic
```bash
# Find domain classification components
find /home/xai/Documents/sunset -name "*.py" -exec grep -l "domain.*classification\|banking_sales\|management_consulting" {} \;
```

### Step 2: Analyze Job 50571 Classification Path
```python
# Debug classification process with clean content
job_data = load_job_50571_clean_content()
classification_result = run_domain_classifier(job_data)
print(f"Classification: {classification_result}")
print(f"Confidence scores: {classification_result.scores}")
```

### Step 3: Boundary Analysis
- Map keywords that trigger "banking_sales" classification
- Identify management consulting signal words
- Analyze overlap and conflicts between domains

### Step 4: Improvement Implementation
- Enhance classification rules for consulting roles in financial services
- Weight management consulting signals appropriately  
- Test with all 5 clean content samples

## üìã SUCCESS METRICS

### Classification Accuracy Targets
- **Job 50571**: "management_consulting" (currently "banking_sales")
- **Other Jobs**: Maintain or improve current classifications
- **Overall Accuracy**: Measure improvement across test set

### Integration Requirements
- Seamless integration with Content Extraction Specialist
- Maintain Excel reporting format (27 columns)
- No regression in content extraction performance (80-90% reduction)

## üåÖ SANDY'S SUNSET RULES APPLICATION

### Collaborative Excellence
- Document all investigation steps
- Create validation reports for each change
- Maintain session continuity with handover protocols
- Apply iterative improvement methodology

### Quality Assurance
- Test classification changes against all 5 jobs
- Validate no regression in content extraction
- Ensure Excel reports remain consistent
- Document improvement rationale and results

## üöÄ READY FOR PHASE 2 LAUNCH

### Prerequisites Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Content Extraction Specialist validated and productionized
- [x] 84.1% average content reduction achieved
- [x] Excel validation reports with clean + messy content
- [x] Investigation scope defined and documented
- [x] Technical approach planned and ready

### Next Actions  
1. **Locate Classification Code**: Find domain classification logic in codebase
2. **Debug Job 50571**: Trace why it's classified as banking_sales  
3. **Analyze Boundaries**: Understand management_consulting vs banking_sales rules
4. **Implement Improvements**: Enhance classification for consulting roles
5. **Validate Results**: Test across all clean content samples
