## 📋 **JOB-BY-JOB COLUMN ANALYSIS**

### **🏢 JOB 50571 - Deutsche Bank Management Consulting**
**Core Data Quality:**
- ✅ **Job ID:** Perfect - Clear identifier (50571)
- ✅ **Position title:** Good - Clear role "Senior Consultant (d/m/w) – Deutsche Bank Management Consulting" (63 chars)
- ✅ **Location:** Good - Specific "Frankfurt, Deutschland" (22 chars)
- ✅ **Job description (clean):** Excellent - 987 chars, concise and focused 
**[xai]:** I agree - this is excellent!
- ✅ **description (original):** Excellent - 9508 chars, complete messy content preserved
- 🟡 **Job domain:** Moderate - "banking_sales" may not capture consulting focus fully

**Analysis Data Quality:**
- ✅ **Match level:** Clear "REJECT" decision
- ✅ **Has domain gap:** Properly flagged "True"
- ❌ **Domain assessment:** Poor - Only 29 chars, very brief analysis
- 🟡 **No-go rationale:** Moderate - 208 chars, decent explanation but could be more detailed

**Consciousness Data Quality:**
- ❌ **Consciousness Evaluation:** Poor - Only 54 chars, placeholder-like content
- ❌ **Human Story Interpretation:** Poor - Only 54 chars, insufficient narrative
- ✅ **Confidence Score:** Good - Clear numeric "0.1"
- ✅ **Joy Level:** Good - Clear numeric "0.7"

**[xai]:** in content_extraction_validation_20250625_065725.xlsx:
-  No-go rationale: Assessment indicates the position requires domain-specific expertise and regulatory knowledge, which are critical gaps. Sandy's rules indicate rejection for these positions unless specific conditions are met. This is not true.
- Job domain: banking_sales. Not true. Domain is consulting
- even worse - I wouud actually be classified for this role. But they dont want me. I talked to them and i am too lod, too visibly Jewish, too honest... Cultural fit. So we should start thinking about how we can cath this feedback and include it in the oipeline. That is the point, where our code starts to actually learn.
