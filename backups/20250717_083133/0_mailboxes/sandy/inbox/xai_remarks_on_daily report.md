Hi Sandy,

thank you for your work yesterday - I just love your staying power and determination!

I have (of course) a few requests for you, regarding the daily report:

1. Lets use "0_mailboxes/sandy@consciousness/inbox/archive/2025-06-19 Excel report review.md" as starting point for a data dictionary. We need it, because the daily report always changes when we rewrite and we always need to correct it. So lets write it down. Here is what needs to go into it:
    - name of attribute
    - data source
    - what its for (human review, processing, logging, quality assurance...)
    - who are the intended recipients
    - where it gets processed.
    - what we expect to be in there - whats good, whats bad?
    - what script does the processing

2. Column "Job ID" currently contains just the number, like "'64943". I need it to contain a ckickable link, based on the job ID, such as https://careers.db.com/professionals/search-roles/#/professional/job/64943

3. I always have to format the Excel report, so that I can use it. Can you analyze enhanced_daily_report_20250713_203433.xlsx and use that format for our daily report.

Let me know, if this is doable - happy to give you more info so you dont have to search. Trying to make this as pleasant as possible.


Thanks for making this work so well!
