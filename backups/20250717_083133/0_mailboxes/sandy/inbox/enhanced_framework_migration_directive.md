## üéØ **STRATEGIC DECISION RENDERED**

Sandy, after thorough analysis with Xai, our strategic directive is **clear and uncompromising**:

**WE MIGRATE FORWARD TO ENHANCED REALITY - NO ABSTRACTION LAYERS**

## üìã **RATIONALE FOR DECISION**

Your bridge work was excellent tactical thinking, but strategic clarity demands we choose the superior path:

### **Key Decision Factors:**
- ‚úÖ **No Legacy Data Constraints**: We can regenerate everything fresh  
- ‚úÖ **No Downstream Dependencies**: We are the end consumers  
- ‚úÖ **Unlimited Timeline**: Clean migration preferred over quick fixes  
- ‚úÖ **Superior Framework**: Enhanced 5-bucket + competency data is objectively better  
- ‚úÖ **Future-Proof Architecture**: All future extractions target enhanced format  

### **Strategic Philosophy:**
*"Bend systems to reality, don't bend reality to systems"*  
Our enhanced extractor produces superior intelligence - let's use it fully!
