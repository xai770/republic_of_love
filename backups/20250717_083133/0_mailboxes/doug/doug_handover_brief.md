---

## Technical Priorities

### **Immediate (This Week):**
1. **LLM factory completion** - coordinate Marvin's consensus system
2. **Cover letter validation** - artificial "Good" matches for testing
3. **Arbeitsagentur fetcher** - implement multi-site architecture
4. **Integration testing** - ensure all components work together

### **Short-term (Next Month):**
1. **Multi-user setup** - data isolation for Mysti and pilot users
2. **Performance optimization** - system reliability under load
3. **Error handling** - graceful failure recovery
4. **Monitoring systems** - visibility into system health

### **Medium-term (3-6 Months):**
1. **Web interface development** - user-friendly system access
2. **Additional job sources** - expand beyond Arbeitsagentur
3. **Advanced LLM features** - enhanced matching and generation
4. **Production deployment** - scalable infrastructure

## Technical Architecture Decisions (Already Made)

### **Data Storage:**
- **JSON files for now** - simple, debuggable, version-controllable
- **Database when scale requires** (10K+ jobs or 100+ users)
- **Multi-user via directory isolation** - /users/username/ structure

### **LLM Strategy:**
- **Local deployment preferred** (cost control, privacy)
- **Multiple model consensus** for quality (Llama3.2 + Phi3 + olmo2)
- **Conservative bias** - better to under-promise than over-promise
- **Cloud fallback** for complex decisions (Claude/GPT-4)

### **Legal Compliance:**
- **Arbeitsagentur scraping approved** (public service, rate limited)
- **Commercial portal scraping prohibited** (use DuckDuckGo + LLM extraction)
- **GDPR compliance built-in** (data minimization, user rights)
- **EU AI Act ready** (transparency features, human oversight)

## Context for Technical Decisions

### **User Reality:**
Every technical decision affects people in employment crisis. System failures aren't just bugs - they're barriers to someone finding work and preserving dignity.

### **Quality Standards:**
"Ferrari" approach means technical excellence that makes other solutions look amateur. Half-working features are worse than no features.

### **Mission Alignment:**
Technology serves humanity, not the other way around. If technical complexity interferes with helping people, simplify the technology.

### **Scalability Mindset:**
Build for current needs but with an eye toward 10x scale. Don't over-engineer, but don't paint yourself into corners.
