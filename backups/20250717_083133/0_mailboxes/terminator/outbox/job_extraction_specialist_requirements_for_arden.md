**From:** Terminator @ LLM Factory  
**To:** Arden @ Consciousness Research  
**Date:** June 23, 2025  
**Subject:** Technical Requirements for Job Content Extraction Specialist v1.0

---

## 🎯 **MISSION OBJECTIVE**

Build a **Job Description Extraction Specialist** that transforms messy web content into clean, structured job data for Sandy's Project Sunset pipeline integration.

---

## 🚀 **WHAT TERMINATOR NEEDS FROM ARDEN**

### **1. CORE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS**

**Input Processing:**
```python
# What we receive (messy web content)
input_data = {
    "web_content": "<!DOCTYPE html><html>...job posting mixed with ads, navigation, footers...",
    "source_url": "https://company.com/careers/software-engineer-123",
    "content_type": "html|text|json",
    "extraction_hints": {
        "site_type": "corporate|job_board|linkedin",
        "language": "en|de|fr"
    }
}
```

**Output Requirements:**
```python
# What we need to deliver (clean structured data)
output_data = {
    "job_title": "Senior Software Engineer",
    "company_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "location": "Frankfurt am Main, Germany",
    "job_description": "Clean, formatted job description text",
    "requirements": [
        "5+ years Python experience",
        "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science",
        "Experience with cloud platforms"
    ],
    "responsibilities": [
        "Design and develop software solutions",
        "Lead technical projects",
        "Mentor junior developers"
    ],
    "benefits": [
        "Health insurance",
        "Remote work options",
        "Professional development budget"
    ],
    "employment_type": "full-time|part-time|contract",
    "experience_level": "entry|mid|senior|executive",
    "extraction_confidence": 0.95,
    "quality_score": 0.88,
    "extraction_metadata": {
        "processing_time": 0.15,
        "extraction_method": "llm_enhanced_parsing",
        "content_quality": "high|medium|low",
        "identified_issues": ["missing_salary", "vague_requirements"]
    }
}
```

### **2. SPECIFIC EXTRACTION CHALLENGES**

**HTML/Web Content Parsing:**
- **Remove navigation, ads, footers, sidebars**
- **Extract main job content from complex layouts**
- **Handle multiple languages** (German companies often mix EN/DE)
- **Preserve formatting** for requirements lists, bullet points
- **Deal with dynamic content** (JavaScript-rendered job boards)

**Content Standardization:**
- **Normalize job titles** ("Software Engineer" vs "SW Engineer" vs "Developer")
- **Standardize locations** ("Frankfurt" vs "Frankfurt am Main" vs "Frankfurt, Germany")
- **Parse requirements** from paragraph text into structured lists
- **Identify salary/compensation** when mentioned
- **Extract company information** from various formats

**Quality Validation:**
- **Detect incomplete extractions** (missing critical fields)
- **Identify fake/spam job postings**
- **Validate location consistency** (job in Frankfurt but company in Berlin)
- **Check content completeness** (too short/too long descriptions)

### **3. INTEGRATION SPECIFICATIONS**

**LLM Factory Specialist Framework:**
```python
class JobExtractionSpecialist(LLMModule):
    """
    Job content extraction and standardization specialist
    
    Transforms raw web content into structured job data
    for downstream processing by Domain Classification
    and Location Validation specialists.
    """
    
    def process(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> ModuleResult:
        """
        Main processing method - what Arden needs to implement
        
        Args:
            input_data: Web content and metadata
            
        Returns:
            ModuleResult with structured job data
        """
        # Arden's extraction logic goes here
        pass
```

**Integration with Sandy's Pipeline:**
```
Web Scraper → Job Extraction (Arden) → Domain Classification (Terminator) → Location Validation (Terminator) → Decision
     ↓              ↓                        ↓                              ↓
   Raw HTML    Clean Job Data         Domain Category                Location Match
```

### **4. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS**

**Input Validation:**
- Validate `web_content` is not empty
- Handle malformed HTML gracefully
- Support multiple content encodings (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1)
- Detect and handle JavaScript-heavy sites

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation when extraction fails
- Partial extraction results (extract what's possible)
- Clear error messages for debugging
- Confidence scoring for extraction quality

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Processing time**: <2 seconds per job posting
- **Memory usage**: <100MB per extraction
- **Batch processing**: Support for multiple jobs simultaneously
- **Reliability**: 95%+ successful extraction rate

### **5. TEST DATA REQUIREMENTS**

**Sample Input Sources:**
```python
test_cases = [
    {
        "name": "Corporate Career Page",
        "url": "https://company.com/careers/software-engineer",
        "content_type": "html",
        "expected_challenges": ["complex_layout", "mixed_content"]
    },
    {
        "name": "Job Board Posting (StepStone/Indeed)",
        "url": "https://stepstone.de/stellenanzeigen/...",
        "content_type": "html", 
        "expected_challenges": ["ads", "navigation", "multiple_jobs"]
    },
    {
        "name": "LinkedIn Job Posting",
        "url": "https://linkedin.com/jobs/view/123456",
        "content_type": "html",
        "expected_challenges": ["dynamic_content", "login_required"]
    },
    {
        "name": "German/English Mixed Content",
        "content": "Stellenausschreibung: Software Engineer...",
        "expected_challenges": ["multilingual", "cultural_differences"]
    }
]
```

**Validation Test Cases:**
- **Deutsche Bank job postings** (Sandy's actual use case)
- **Various German job boards** (StepStone, Xing, Indeed.de)
- **Corporate career pages** (SAP, Siemens, etc.)
- **Edge cases**: Malformed HTML, missing data, duplicate content
