**DATE**: June 4, 2025  
**SUBJECT**: Specialist Request for Critical LLM Quality Issues  
**PRIORITY**: HIGH  

---

## Background

We've completed an audit of our job application automation system and discovered critical quality issues with current LLM integration. The existing cover letter generation produces broken outputs with AI artifacts, fragmented sentences, and unprofessional content - exactly the problems your LLM Factory was designed to solve.

We have **one excellent specialist** available (JobFitnessEvaluatorV2) but need additional specialists to complete our quality transformation.

## Current Problems Requiring Specialists

### üö® **CRITICAL: Cover Letter Generation**
