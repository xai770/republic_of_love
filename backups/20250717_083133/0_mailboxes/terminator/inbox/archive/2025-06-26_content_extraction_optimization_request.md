**Subject:** Content Extraction Specialist Optimization for Skill Matching

## **REQUEST SUMMARY**

The Content Extraction Specialist output format needs optimization for CV-to-job skill matching. Current outputs contain excessive redundancy and formatting that interferes with automated matching algorithms.

## **CURRENT PROBLEMS**

### **Redundant Content:**
❌ **Boilerplate text:** "Here is the extracted content:"  
❌ **Duplicate job metadata:** Job Title, Full/Part-Time, Regular/Temporary repeated multiple times  
❌ **Redundant sections:** "Experience Requirements" + "Educational Requirements" often contain identical information  
❌ **Multiple location references:** Location mentioned in 3+ different sections  
❌ **Unnecessary dating:** "Listed: 2025-06-03" not relevant for skill matching  

### **Inconsistent Formatting:**
❌ **Mixed section headers:** Some use "Job Title and Role Specifics:" others "Job Title and Role Specifics"  
❌ **Language mixing:** German requirements in English job descriptions  
❌ **Variable section names:** "Skills:" vs "Technical Skills and Requirements"  

### **Non-Essential Sections:**
❌ **"Industry-Specific Terminology"** - questionable value for skill matching  
❌ **Verbose job descriptions** with repeated phrasing  

## **REQUESTED OUTPUT FORMAT**

For optimal CV-to-job matching, please update Content Extraction Specialist to output:

```markdown
**Position:** [Job Title] - [Location]

**Required Skills:**
- [Technical skills, software, tools]
- [Programming languages, databases]
- [Certifications, frameworks]

**Key Responsibilities:**
- [Core job duties]
- [Primary activities]

**Experience Required:**
- [Education level]
- [Years of experience]
- [Industry background]
```

## **BENEFITS OF OPTIMIZATION**

✅ **Cleaner matching algorithms** - Remove formatting noise  
✅ **Consistent structure** - Standardized sections across all jobs  
✅ **Reduced redundancy** - Essential information only  
✅ **Better parsing** - Simplified for automated CV comparison  
✅ **Language consistency** - English only for international matching  

## **CURRENT WORKFLOW IMPACT**
