Subject where we are, let's plan the next steps 

Hi copilot@llm_factory

(Can you give yourself an easier name I can call you?)

demo_complete_integration.py is currently not using local LLMs, but mockups. We cannot go into testing like that. 

We spent much time trying to fix the demo script and I don't see much progress. Still no LLMs being used. 

Let's discuss a few ideas.

- each specialist should have a test script in his folder. We could review these - perhaps they use real LLMs already.
- if they don't, let's fix them
- once all are fixed, we can recreate the demo script
- we could also just continue to debug the demo script. Perhaps I am panicking and the script is almost ready.
- I am happy with totally removing the mock client and it's components. This would force an error when we have a problem with Ollama instead of letting the tests and demo pass, sending the message that llm_factory is working when it's not.
- Ada is your manager of sorts. If you like, we can discuss with her how to continue (if you want )
- we could rethink the whole demo idea and create a dynamic report, which checks each and every specialist and indicates status for each of these: 1. Specialist exists, has code, has tests, can work with Ollama, achieve goal etc. 

Here is what I want fro you. 

- tell me how you suggest we proceed best
- create a Dev log document and record there all we try. This will prevent us from running in circles. 
- start work. We told everyone that llm_factory was ready, so let's make it ready. 

Thank you for your great work, let's do this!
