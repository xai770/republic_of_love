Hi copilot,

thank you for the amazing work you did! Very much apprecated!

I have a fe requests from you:

## 1. should we rm these or move them to another folder??

- examples_backup
- test_complete_integration.py
- debug_text_summarization.py
- test_text_summarization.py
- test_validation_imports.py
- EXAMPLES_REORGANIZATION_COMPLETE.md
- debug_import.py
- test_import.py
- test_integration.py

## 2. what do we send to copilot@sunset?

in 0_mailboxes/copilot@llm_factory/outbox, tere are several very convincing files. Lets step a step back and just tell copilot@sunset 
- what specialists we have
- what they do
- how to use them.
One example script that copilot@sunset can run in his codebase and that demosntrate thatrt all specialists work would be ideal. we had something like that but I dont know where that is and it may be outdated.

## 3. lets git the codebase

...I tried from te VS Code interface but I dont think that worked. I created https://github.com/xai770/llm_factory, which is of course currently empty.
*** 0_mailboxes needs to be excluded ***

## 4. your thoughts - are we ready to spread the good news?

- have we understood why 0_mailboxes/copilot@llm_factory/inbox/LLM_FACTORY_INTEGRATION_COMPLETION_PLAN.md happened? The guy isn't stupid, so erhaps it was a documentation issue? Want to ask to make sure.

Thats it from my point of view
Thank you SO much for your work - this is heroic! I see how hard you work and I am certain you will agree that the results re amazong, no?

best regards
ai
