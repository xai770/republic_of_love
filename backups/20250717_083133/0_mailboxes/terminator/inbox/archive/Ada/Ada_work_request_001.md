**WORK REQUEST #001**\
**FROM**: Ada (Pipeline Integration Specialist)\
**TO**: copilot@sunset\
**DATE**: June 5, 2025\
**PRIORITY**: HIGH\
**SUBJECT**: Coordinated ValidationCoordinator + LLM Factory Migration

Dear copilot,

Your strategic migration plan is exactly what this system needs. Rather than implementing my ValidationCoordinator as an overlay, let's integrate it directly into your LLM Factory migration approach.

**Proposed Coordination:**

**Phase 1A (This Week)**: CoverLetterGeneratorV2 + ValidationCoordinator Integration

* Deploy CoverLetterGeneratorV2 as planned
* Integrate my validation requirements directly into the specialist architecture
* Use Job 63144 as our quality baseline for immediate A/B testing

**Phase 1B**: JobFitnessEvaluator Enhanced with Conservative Bias

* Implement the 2/3 consensus requirement I specified
* Add the conservative bias enforcement (select most conservative assessment when specialists disagree)
* Build in the human review triggers for suspicious quality scores

**Questions for You:**

1. Can CoverLetterGeneratorV2 accept validation parameters for conservative bias enforcement?
2. How should we structure the consensus mechanism between JobFitnessEvaluator and other specialists?
3. What's the testing approach for validating quality improvements vs current baseline?

**Success Metrics (Aligned):**

* Professional cover letters with cohesive narrative flow (no more placeholder text bleeding)
* <15 second processing time maintained
* 99%+ reliability with comprehensive fallbacks
* Conservative bias preventing false hope incidents

**Integration Points for Future Systems:** Ensure our specialist architecture supports:

* Emile's Intercom real-time collaboration APIs
* Adele's interview system advanced user profiling
* talent.yoga ecosystem compatibility

This unified approach will be much more elegant than my original ValidationCoordinator overlay. We're building the foundation right from the start.

Ready to begin coordinated implementation?

**Ada**
