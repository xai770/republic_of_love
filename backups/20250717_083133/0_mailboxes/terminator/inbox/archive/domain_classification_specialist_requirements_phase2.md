### **Integration Requirements**

#### **LLM Factory Architecture Integration**
```python
# Use existing ModuleConfig and SpecialistRegistry patterns
class DomainClassificationSpecialist:
    def __init__(self, config: ModuleConfig):
        self.config = config
        self.client = OllamaClient(config)
        
    def classify_domain_alignment(self, cv_data, job_data):
        # Leverage existing LLM Factory infrastructure
        return classification_result
```

#### **Sunset Pipeline Integration**  
```python
# Integrate with existing direct_specialist_manager.py
from core.direct_specialist_manager import DirectSpecialistManager

def enhanced_job_evaluation_pipeline(cv_data, job_data):
    # Step 1: Location Validation (100% validated)
    location_result = location_validation_specialist(job_data)
    if location_result.conflict_detected:
        return early_rejection("Location conflict")
    
    # Step 2: Domain Classification (NEW)
    domain_result = domain_classification_specialist(cv_data, job_data)
    if domain_result.mismatch_severity == "critical":
        return early_rejection("Critical domain mismatch")
    
    # Step 3: Continue with detailed evaluation
    return detailed_evaluation_pipeline(cv_data, job_data)
```

### **Success Metrics**

- Correctly identify 3/3 domain alignments as "STRONG_MATCH" or "SOFT_MATCH"
- Zero false positives (don't reject good domain matches)
- Zero false negatives (don't miss critical domain gaps)

#### **Performance Requirements**
- **Processing time:** <2 seconds per job
- **Confidence threshold:** >0.80 for production decisions
- **Integration:** Zero-disruption with existing pipeline

### **Delivery Format**
1. **Quick test script** (like `quick_start_for_sandy.py`) with domain classification examples
2. **Full LLM Factory specialist** with complete documentation  
3. **Integration instructions** for `direct_specialist_manager.py`
4. **Test validation** against our 9-job golden dataset
