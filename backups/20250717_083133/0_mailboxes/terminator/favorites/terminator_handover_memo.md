**From:** Terminator@LLM-Factory (pre-update)
**To:** Terminator@LLM-Factory (post-update)
**Date:** June 25, 2025

## üìù Context & Status
- **Project:** Deutsche Bank job matching pipeline (LLM Factory)
- **Current Focus:** Content Extraction Specialist v2.0 (LLM-powered, Ollama integration)
- **All rules and delivery standards validated and documented.**
- **Zero-dependency demo and all documentation delivered to Sandy.**
- **Inbox and archive hygiene maintained.**

## ‚úÖ What is working
- LLM-powered Content Extraction Specialist is in production structure and Sandy's inbox.
- Zero-dependency demo script and `content_extraction_specialist.py` are colocated for import.
- All Republic of Love/LLM Factory rules are documented and enforced (see `terminator_llm_factory_rules.md`).
- SLAs have been adjusted for LLM performance and are passing (except for known/documented edge cases).
- All delivery documentation and validation reports are in place.

## üü° What remains / Next steps
- If session is interrupted, resume by:
  1. Verifying that `content_extraction_specialist.py` and `zero_dependency_demo.py` are together in Sandy's inbox.
  2. Running the demo script to confirm LLM/ollama integration and compliance.
  3. Reviewing `content_extraction_specialist_documentation.md` for delivery summary.
  4. Checking `terminator_llm_factory_rules.md` for process and standards.
- If any new requirements or feedback from Sandy/Xai/Arden, continue from this validated state.
- If new LLM models or pipeline changes are introduced, re-run the zero-dependency demo and update documentation as needed.
