# Real Data Testing Plan for LLM Factory Specialists

## What are we testing?
We are testing the LLM Factory's specialist modules—specifically the `JobFitnessEvaluatorSpecialist` and its adversarial verification pipeline—using real-world data. The test uses actual job postings (from `test_data/job63144.json` and similar files) and a real CV (from `test_data/Gershons_concise_cv.md`). The goal is to:
- Validate that the specialist can process real, unstructured data and extract meaningful job-candidate fit assessments.
- Ensure the validation logic correctly flags malformed or incomplete input.
- Confirm that adversarial reasoning and risk analysis are triggered and reported as expected.

## What are the results?
- The specialist successfully parses and evaluates real job and CV data, returning a detailed fitness assessment, risk factors, and adversarial insights.
- The validation logic robustly rejects malformed or incomplete input, providing clear error messages (e.g., missing fields, wrong types, empty input).
- For valid input, the LLM-backed specialist produces a conservative, evidence-based recommendation, including adversarial critique and risk analysis.

## Why is this good?
- **Realism:** The test uses actual job and CV data, not synthetic or mock examples, ensuring the system works in real-world scenarios.
- **Robustness:** The validation logic prevents bad data from reaching the LLM, reducing wasted compute and improving reliability.
- **Transparency:** The output includes not just a score, but also adversarial reasoning, risk factors, and a full trace of the specialist's logic.
- **Extensibility:** The same approach can be used to test other specialists (e.g., FactualConsistencySpecialist, LanguageCoherenceSpecialist) and more complex data.

## What are the next steps?
- **Batch Testing:** Run the pipeline on a larger set of job postings and CVs to benchmark performance and coverage.
- **Specialist Expansion:** Add tests for other specialists (e.g., factual consistency, language coherence) using real data.
- **Integration:** Connect the specialist pipeline to the JMFS production system for live candidate-job matching.
- **Analysis:** Review and analyze the outputs to tune specialist prompts, thresholds, and risk logic for better accuracy and user value.
- **Performance:** Optimize LLM calls and data parsing for production-scale throughput.
