You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: llama3.2:latest\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n4. Experience Requirements: Years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels\n5. Education Requirements: Degrees, certifications, qualifications\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nExtract real skills mentioned in the job description. Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n- Model output: Here is the extracted JSON object with the requested keys:\n\n{\n  \"technical_requirements\": \"Python; JavaScript; AWS\",\n  \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n  \"soft_skills\": \"\",\n  \"experience_requirements\": \"3+ years of experience, Bachelor's degree in Computer Science\",\n  \"education_requirements\": \"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science\"\n}\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt is too broad and doesn't specify what skills to extract, how to categorize them, or what format the output should be in.\n2. The prompt assumes that all skills mentioned in the job description will fall under one of the five categories (Technical, Business, Soft Skills, Experience Requirements, Education Requirements), which might not always be the case.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nAnalyze this job posting and extract relevant skills, specifically those related to programming languages, software tools, technologies, domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions, communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities, years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels, degrees, certifications, qualifications. Return ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_skills\": \"\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"communication\": \"\",\n    \"leadership\": \"\",\n    \"teamwork\": \"\",\n    \"problem-solving\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT continues with: \n\nExtract real skills mentioned in the job description. Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The improved prompt is more specific about what skills to extract (e.g., programming languages, domain knowledge) and how to categorize them (e.g., by skill type). This should help the model focus on the most relevant skills.\n2. By specifying exact keys in the output JSON object, the prompt ensures that the model returns a consistent format for the extracted skills.\n3. The addition of specific skill types (e.g., communication, leadership) and categories (e.g., experience requirements, education requirements) helps to ensure that the model considers a wider range of skills, rather than just assuming they fall under one category.\n4. The phrase \"Return ONLY\" emphasizes the importance of providing an accurate and complete output in the specified format, which should help improve the overall quality of the model's performance.\n\nThis improved prompt is designed to provide more context, clarity, and specificity for the model, allowing it to better understand what skills need to be extracted and how they should be categorized. By making these changes, the model should be able to produce a more accurate and complete output in the correct format.",
