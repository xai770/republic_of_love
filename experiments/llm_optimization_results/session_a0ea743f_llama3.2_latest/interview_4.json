You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: llama3.2:latest\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: Extract relevant programming languages, software tools, technologies, domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions, technical requirements (including years of experience and specific backgrounds), from this job posting. Use semicolon separation for programming languages and skills categories; use comma separation within each category where applicable. Ensure consistency in formatting by following the provided JSON structure: {\n    \"technical_skills\": \"\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n- Model output: I'm happy to help you with extracting the relevant information from the job posting. However, I don't see a job posting provided. Please share the job posting, and I'll extract the required information in the specified format.\n\nOnce you provide the job posting, I'll assist you in breaking down the information into categories such as technical skills, domain knowledge, processes and methodologies, business functions, experience requirements, education requirements, and programming languages (in semicolon-separated format).\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is incomplete and unclear, leading to a poor performance score of 0.00/1.0. The main issues are:\n\n* Lack of specificity: The prompt does not provide any information about the job posting itself.\n* Inadequate guidance: The model expects the user to share the job posting, but it doesn't specify what type of information is required from the posting.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\nExtract relevant programming languages, software tools, technologies, domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions, technical requirements (including years of experience and specific backgrounds), from a sample job posting. Use semicolon separation for programming languages and skills categories; use comma separation within each category where applicable. Ensure consistency in formatting by following the provided JSON structure: {\n    \"technical_skills\": \"\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\nPlease provide a sample job posting with the following characteristics:\n- A company name and position title\n- Job description and key responsibilities\n- List of required skills, qualifications, or certifications\n- Industry or domain information\n\nREASONING:\n\nThe improved prompt provides necessary guidance to the model by:\n\n* Specifying that it should extract relevant information from a sample job posting.\n* Providing characteristics of an ideal job posting (company name, position title, job description, etc.).\n* Ensuring consistency in formatting with the provided JSON structure.\n\nBy providing this level of specificity and guidance, the model will be better equipped to accurately extract the required skills categories from the job posting.",
