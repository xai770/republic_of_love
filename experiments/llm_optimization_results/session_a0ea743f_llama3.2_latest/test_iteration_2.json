Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The improved prompt is more specific about what skills to extract (e.g., programming languages, domain knowledge) and how to categorize them (e.g., by skill type). This should help the model focus on the most relevant skills.\n2. By specifying exact keys in the output JSON object, the prompt ensures that the model returns a consistent format for the extracted skills.\n3. The addition of specific skill types (e.g., communication, leadership) and categories (e.g., experience requirements, education requirements) helps to ensure that the model considers a wider range of skills, rather than just assuming they fall under one category.\n4. The phrase \"Return ONLY\" emphasizes the importance of providing an accurate and complete output in the specified format, which should help improve the overall quality of the model's performance.\n\nThis improved prompt is designed to provide more context, clarity, and specificity for the model, allowing it to better understand what skills need to be extracted and how they should be categorized. By making these changes, the model should be able to produce a more accurate and complete output in the correct format.",

  "output": "Given the lack of the job posting text, I'll demonstrate how the improved prompt would be used with an example job posting.\n\nAssume we have the following job posting:\n\n\"Seeking a software engineer with expertise in Python, Java, and C++ to join our team. Experience with Agile development methodologies and cloud-based technologies such as AWS is a plus. The ideal candidate will possess strong problem-solving skills and excellent communication abilities.\"\n\nUsing this example, I would analyze the job posting and extract the relevant skills according to the improved prompt:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"technical_skills\": \"Python;Java;C++\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"Agile development methodologies\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"communication\": \"Excellent communication abilities\",\n    \"leadership\": \"\",\n    \"teamwork\": \"\",\n    \"problem-solving\": \"Strong problem-solving skills\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"Experience with Agile development methodologies and cloud-based technologies such as AWS\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the extracted skills include programming languages (Python, Java, C++), software processes/methodologies (Agile development methodologies), business functions (none mentioned explicitly), communication skills (Excellent communication abilities), problem-solving skills (Strong problem-solving skills), and experience requirements (Experience with Agile development methodologies and cloud-based technologies such as AWS).",
