You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: llama3.2:latest\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: ```\nExtract relevant programming languages, software tools, technologies, domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions, communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities, years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels, degrees, certifications, qualifications from this job posting. Use semicolon separation for programming languages and skills categories; use comma separation within each category where applicable. Ensure consistency in formatting by following the provided JSON structure: {\n    \"technical_skills\": \"\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"communication\": \"\",\n    \"leadership\": \"\",\n    \"teamwork\": \"\",\n    \"problem-solving\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n- Model output: Unfortunately, you didn't provide the job posting. Please paste the text of the job posting, and I'll extract the relevant information according to the specified format.\n\nOnce you provide the text, I'll create a JSON object with the extracted information, formatted as requested: { \"technical_skills\": \"\", \"domain_knowledge\": \"\", \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\", \"business_functions\": \"\", \"communication\": \"\", \"leadership\": \"\", \"teamwork\": \"\", \"problem-solving\": \"\", \"experience_requirements\": \"\", \"education_requirements\": \"\" }\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is too broad and lacks specificity, which may have contributed to the model's poor performance. The prompt asks for extraction of \"all\" relevant information from the job posting, without providing any context or hints about what specific aspects of the job posting are most important.\n\nAdditionally, the prompt is asking for a wide range of skills categories, including communication and leadership, which are not necessarily technical skills that can be extracted from a job posting. This may have led to the model struggling to determine how to categorize these skills.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nExtract relevant programming languages, software tools, technologies, domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions, technical requirements (including years of experience and specific backgrounds), from this job posting. Use semicolon separation for programming languages and skills categories; use comma separation within each category where applicable. Ensure consistency in formatting by following the provided JSON structure: {\n    \"technical_skills\": \"\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n\nREASONING:\n\n1. **Specificity**: By narrowing down the scope of skills categories to only those that are typically found in a job posting (programming languages, software tools, technologies, business functions, and technical requirements), we make it easier for the model to determine what information is relevant.\n2. **Reduced ambiguity**: Removing non-technical skill categories like communication and leadership helps to avoid confusion and ensures that the model focuses on extracting skills that are directly related to the job posting.\n3. **Improved categorization**: By explicitly stating the types of technical requirements we're interested in (years of experience and specific backgrounds), we provide clear guidance for the model, making it easier to extract relevant information from the job posting.\n\nThis revised prompt should help improve the model's performance by providing a clearer understanding of what is being asked and reducing the ambiguity surrounding skill categories.",
