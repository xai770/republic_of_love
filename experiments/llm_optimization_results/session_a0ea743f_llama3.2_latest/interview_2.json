You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: llama3.2:latest\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and extract relevant skills, specifically those related to programming languages, software tools, technologies, domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions, communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities, years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels, degrees, certifications, qualifications. Return ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_skills\": \"\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"communication\": \"\",\n    \"leadership\": \"\",\n    \"teamwork\": \"\",\n    \"problem-solving\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT continues with: \n\nExtract real skills mentioned in the job description. Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1. The improved prompt is more specific about what skills to extract (e.g., programming languages, domain knowledge) and how to categorize them (e.g., by skill type). This should help the model focus on the most relevant skills.\n2. By specifying exact keys in the output JSON object, the prompt ensures that the model returns a consistent format for the extracted skills.\n3. The addition of specific skill types (e.g., communication, leadership) and categories (e.g., experience requirements, education requirements) helps to ensure that the model considers a wider range of skills, rather than just assuming they fall under one category.\n4. The phrase \"Return ONLY\" emphasizes the importance of providing an accurate and complete output in the specified format, which should help improve the overall quality of the model's performance.\n\nThis improved prompt is designed to provide more context, clarity, and specificity for the model, allowing it to better understand what skills need to be extracted and how they should be categorized. By making these changes, the model should be able to produce a more accurate and complete output in the correct format.\n- Model output: Given the lack of the job posting text, I'll demonstrate how the improved prompt would be used with an example job posting.\n\nAssume we have the following job posting:\n\n\"Seeking a software engineer with expertise in Python, Java, and C++ to join our team. Experience with Agile development methodologies and cloud-based technologies such as AWS is a plus. The ideal candidate will possess strong problem-solving skills and excellent communication abilities.\"\n\nUsing this example, I would analyze the job posting and extract the relevant skills according to the improved prompt:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"technical_skills\": \"Python;Java;C++\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"Agile development methodologies\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"communication\": \"Excellent communication abilities\",\n    \"leadership\": \"\",\n    \"teamwork\": \"\",\n    \"problem-solving\": \"Strong problem-solving skills\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"Experience with Agile development methodologies and cloud-based technologies such as AWS\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the extracted skills include programming languages (Python, Java, C++), software processes/methodologies (Agile development methodologies), business functions (none mentioned explicitly), communication skills (Excellent communication abilities), problem-solving skills (Strong problem-solving skills), and experience requirements (Experience with Agile development methodologies and cloud-based technologies such as AWS).\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt is too broad and lacks specificity, leading to a lack of focus for the model.\n2. The prompt asks for \"real skills\" mentioned in the job description, but it doesn't provide clear guidance on how to identify and categorize these skills.\n3. The JSON output format requires specific keys, which may not be immediately apparent to the model.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\n```\nExtract relevant programming languages, software tools, technologies, domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions, communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities, years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels, degrees, certifications, qualifications from this job posting. Use semicolon separation for programming languages and skills categories; use comma separation within each category where applicable. Ensure consistency in formatting by following the provided JSON structure: {\n    \"technical_skills\": \"\",\n    \"domain_knowledge\": \"\",\n    \"processes_and_methodologies\": \"\",\n    \"business_functions\": \"\",\n    \"communication\": \"\",\n    \"leadership\": \"\",\n    \"teamwork\": \"\",\n    \"problem-solving\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nREASONING:\n\n1. The improved prompt is more specific about what skills to extract, such as programming languages and domain knowledge.\n2. By adding phrases like \"Use semicolon separation for...\" and \"...follow the provided JSON structure,\" we provide clear guidance on how to format the output.\n3. The use of commas within each category (e.g., \"years of experience\") ensures that relevant information is not overlooked.\n4. The inclusion of specific skills categories (e.g., communication, leadership) helps the model understand what types of skills are being sought.\n\nThese changes should help the LLM perform better by providing a more focused and structured prompt that guides it to extract the desired skills accurately.",
