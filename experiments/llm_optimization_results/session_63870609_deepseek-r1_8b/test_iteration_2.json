  "output": "Thinking...\nOkay, I need to analyze this job posting for a Software Engineer and extract the skills into JSON format. The user provided specific instructions about how to handle certain terms like \"cloud technologies,\" checking for domain specificity, and confirming problem-solving abilities as a standalone skill.\n\nFirst, let me think about what information is needed from the job description. I should look for technical requirements related to programming languages like Python or Java, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), databases systems, DevOps tools, etc. For business requirements, things like Agile methodology, specific domain knowledge if mentioned, project management experience would be relevant.\n\nThe soft skills section typically includes communication abilities, collaboration skills, problem-solving capabilities, adaptability to new technologies or methodologies - these are important for team dynamics and handling complex issues in software development roles.\n\nExperience requirements might mention years of experience needed (like 3-5 years), specific tools or platforms required, familiarity with certain frameworks or architectures. Education usually specifies degree levels like Bachelor's or Master's degrees in Computer Science, Engineering, related fields - sometimes they'll list acceptable alternatives if the field is broader than just CS.\n\nI'm wondering what kind of job posting this might be for? The user didn't provide one, but I can imagine it could be from a tech company looking to hire someone with strong cloud skills. Maybe they're specifically targeting AWS expertise since that's mentioned separately in their example output.\n\nThe example shows how to format the JSON response properly - semicolons separating different skill categories and entries within each category. That makes sense for structured data representation without using more complex formatting like arrays or objects within objects, keeping it simple but informative.\n\nI should be careful with terminology interpretation. For instance, \"cloud technologies\" could mean several things:\n- General cloud concepts\n- Multiple specific platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)\n- Primarily AWS\n\nThe user wants me to distinguish if both general and specific are mentioned. Similarly for experience requirements - I need to separate different aspects like years of experience from platform familiarity.\n\nProblem-solving abilities should be treated as a distinct skill category according to their instructions, not lumped in with technical or business skills.\n...done thinking.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```",
