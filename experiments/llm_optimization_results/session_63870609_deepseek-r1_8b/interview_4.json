You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: deepseek-r1:8b\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting for a Software Engineer and extract skills into JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n\nGiven the job title: Software Engineer, please extract real skills mentioned in the job description using semicolon separation. Specifically, address the following questions:\n- Does \"cloud technologies\" refer to general cloud platforms or AWS specifically? If both, separate them as distinct skills.\n- Are there any domain-specific requirements (e.g., finance, e-commerce) mentioned?\n- Can you confirm if \"problem-solving abilities\" is a standalone skill?\n\nPlease return ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys and the extracted skills separated by semicolons without markdown. If no data is available due to missing input, please provide an empty JSON structure with notes.\n- Model output: Thinking...\nOkay, let me process this job analysis request step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to extract real skills from an unspecified Software Engineer job posting. The user wants a specific JSON format that categorizes technical requirements, business needs, soft skills, experience and education criteria.\n\nThe main challenges here are:\n1) Determining if \"cloud technologies\" refers to general platforms or specifically AWS\n2) Identifying any domain-specific requirements mentioned in the description\n3) Confirming whether problem-solving abilities should be classified as a standalone skill\n\nSince no actual job posting is provided, I'll need to create an example JSON that demonstrates how these skills would be categorized according to the user's specifications. For each section of the output:\n- Technical_requirements will include programming languages and frameworks (like React, Java) - assuming general cloud unless specified\n- Business_requirements might mention domain-specific needs if present in the actual job description\n- Soft_skills includes communication abilities and collaboration\n- Experience_requirements covers years of experience and specific tools mentioned generally\n- Education_requirements lists degree types\n\nI'll use semicolon separation as requested for skills within each category. If any information is missing, I'll leave those fields empty to follow the user's instructions about returning an empty JSON structure with notes.\n\nThe example should clearly show how different skill categories are separated while maintaining proper JSON formatting.\n...done thinking.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** No job description was provided for analysis. The JSON structure remains empty as instructed.\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is incomplete and lacks specific details required to analyze the job posting effectively. The main issues with the prompt are:\n\n1. Lack of actual job description: The model needs a real job posting to extract skills from, but the prompt doesn't provide any.\n2. Ambiguous language: Phrases like \"cloud technologies\" and \"problem-solving abilities\" require clarification on how to interpret them.\n3. Incomplete task requirements: The prompt doesn't specify if there are other skill categories that need to be extracted or if the model should infer some information.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide a real job posting for the Software Engineer position, and I will analyze it for the skills mentioned.\n\nSpecifically, include the following details in the prompt:\n\n* The full text of the job posting\n* Indicate whether you want to extract general cloud platforms or AWS specifically from \"cloud technologies\"\n* Confirm if \"problem-solving abilities\" should be classified as a standalone skill\n* Specify if there are any domain-specific requirements mentioned (e.g., finance, e-commerce)\n\nREASONING:\n\nThe improved prompt addresses the main issues with the original prompt. By providing a real job posting and clarifying specific details, the model can analyze the text more accurately and extract relevant skills from it. The changes ensure that the task is well-defined and the model has enough information to produce a meaningful output.",
