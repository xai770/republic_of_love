Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n- Model output: Thinking...\nOkay, let's start by looking at the user's query again. They want me to analyze a job posting and extract skills into a specific JSON format. The keys are technical_requirements, business_requirements, soft_skills, experience_requirements, and education_requirements.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the provided job description carefully. The title is \"Software Engineer,\" so that's straightforward. Breaking down the description: It mentions Python, JavaScript, cloud technologies, AWS, problem-solving skills, agile environment, 3+ years of experience, and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.\n\nFor technical_skills, I should list programming languages (Python, JavaScript) and tools/technologies (cloud, specifically AWS). Need to make sure these are separated by semicolons. Business_skills would involve methodologies like Agile since that's part of the requirements. Experience_requirements include years (3+), specific background in cloud technologies, and experience with AWS. Education is a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.\n\nWait, does \"cloud technologies\" fall under technical or business? Probably technical because it's about tools and platforms. But maybe they mean expertise in applying those for business solutions. Hmm, the job description doesn't specify any particular domain like finance or e-commerce, so I shouldn't add anything there unless mentioned elsewhere. \n\nSoft skills: The user explicitly mentions problem-solving abilities and working in an agile environment. Agile is already under business_skills though because it's a methodology. So \"problem-solving abilities\" goes to soft_skills. Need to check if any other terms like leadership or teamwork are present, but the example didn't have them.\n\nExperience requirements should include years (3+), cloud technologies experience, and AWS specifically. Education just mentions Computer Science degree. \n\nI need to ensure each category is correctly separated by semicolons without markdown. Also, avoid adding anything not mentioned in the description unless it's implied indirectly. The user emphasized being specific and accurate, so stick strictly to what's there. Maybe double-check terms like \"cloud technologies\" â€“ does that encompass more than just AWS? Yes, but the job only mentions AWS as experience required, so maybe list both cloud tech (general) and AWS separately if possible.\n\nWait, in technical_requirements, should I separate general cloud technologies from AWS? The description says \"experience in Python, JavaScript, and cloud technologies\" then adds \"AWS.\" So perhaps cloud technologies is a broader category including tools like Docker or Kubernetes. But the user might want just what's explicitly mentioned. However, since the job mentions both generic cloud tech and AWS specifically, I should include both.\n\nBut looking at the example response provided by the user: technical_requirements includes Python; JavaScript; Cloud Technologies (AWS). Wait no, in their example, it says \"Cloud Technologies (AWS)\" as one skill. Hmm, maybe that's acceptable if they want to group them together. Alternatively, separate cloud technologies and AWS as two distinct skills.\n\nI think for accuracy, since the job lists both general cloud tech and specifically AWS, including both under technical_skills makes sense. Business_requirements would just have Agile methodology because there's no other domain mentioned. Experience includes 3+ years and specific experience with cloud technologies (which implies AWS). Education is straightforward - Bachelor's in Computer Science.\n\nSo finalizing: Technical skills are Python, JavaScript, Cloud Technologies, and AWS as they're all tools/platforms required. Business_skills include Agile methodology only. Soft_skill is problem-solving abilities. Experience mentions 3+ years and experience with cloud technologies/AWS. Education specifies a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.\n...done thinking.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"Python; JavaScript; Cloud Technologies (AWS)\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"Agile Methodology\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"Problem-solving abilities\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"3+ years of experience; Experience with cloud technologies; Experience with AWS\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science\"\n}\n```\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1.

  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The main issue with the current prompt is that it's too vague and open-ended, allowing for subjective interpretation of the job description. This leads to variations in skill extraction across different analysis sessions.\n\n2. Another problem is the lack of clear guidelines on how to handle ambiguous or context-dependent terms like \"cloud technologies.\" The model struggles to decide whether to include general cloud tech or AWS specifically as separate skills.\n\n3. The prompt also doesn't provide enough context about the expected output format, which might confuse the model.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n```\nAnalyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nGiven the job title: Software Engineer, extract real skills mentioned in the job description, using semicolon separation.
