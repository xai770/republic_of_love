  "output": "Thinking...\nOkay, let me process this job analysis request step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to extract real skills from an unspecified Software Engineer job posting. The user wants a specific JSON format that categorizes technical requirements, business needs, soft skills, experience and education criteria.\n\nThe main challenges here are:\n1) Determining if \"cloud technologies\" refers to general platforms or specifically AWS\n2) Identifying any domain-specific requirements mentioned in the description\n3) Confirming whether problem-solving abilities should be classified as a standalone skill\n\nSince no actual job posting is provided, I'll need to create an example JSON that demonstrates how these skills would be categorized according to the user's specifications. For each section of the output:\n- Technical_requirements will include programming languages and frameworks (like React, Java) - assuming general cloud unless specified\n- Business_requirements might mention domain-specific needs if present in the actual job description\n- Soft_skills includes communication abilities and collaboration\n- Experience_requirements covers years of experience and specific tools mentioned generally\n- Education_requirements lists degree types\n\nI'll use semicolon separation as requested for skills within each category. If any information is missing, I'll leave those fields empty to follow the user's instructions about returning an empty JSON structure with notes.\n\nThe example should clearly show how different skill categories are separated while maintaining proper JSON formatting.\n...done thinking.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** No job description was provided for analysis. The JSON structure remains empty as instructed.",
