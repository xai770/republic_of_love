You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: gemma3n:latest\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: ```json\nAnalyze a sample job posting (e.g., \"Software Engineer\" job description) and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies; e.g., Python, Java, Agile\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions; e.g., cloud computing, project management\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities; e.g., collaboration, time management\n\nUse the following guidelines to categorize skills:\n- Technical: Programming languages, software development tools, technologies\n- Business: Domain knowledge, industry-specific processes, business functions\n- Soft: Communication skills, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nWhen extracting skills, be specific and accurate. If in doubt, prioritize relevance and context.\n\nReturn a JSON object with the following keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\"\n}\n\nInclude experience or education requirements if they are explicitly mentioned in the job description.\n\nExample output format:\n```json\n{\n   \"technical_requirements\": \"Python, AWS, cloud technologies\",\n   \"business_requirements\": \"agile environment, project management\",\n   \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving, teamwork\"\n}\n```\n- Model output: ```json\n{\n  \"technical_requirements\": \"Python, JavaScript, AWS, cloud technologies\",\n  \"business_requirements\": \"agile environment, cloud computing\",\n  \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving\"\n}\n```\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt contains several issues that hinder the model's performance. Firstly, the use of JavaScript in the technical requirements is incorrect since it was not mentioned in the example job description. Additionally, the mention of experience or education requirements in the prompt is not explicitly required in the expected output format.\n\nFurthermore, the use of semicolons (;) to separate skills categories is unnecessary and may lead to errors if a skill belongs to more than one category.\n\nFinally, the prompt does not provide enough guidance on how to handle skills that do not fit into any specific category.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n```json\nAnalyze a sample job posting (e.g., \"Software Engineer\" job description) and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into the following categories:\n- Technical Skills: Programming languages, software development tools, technologies\n- Business Skills: Domain knowledge, industry-specific processes, business functions\n- Soft Skills: Communication skills, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nUse the following guidelines to categorize skills:\n- Prioritize relevance and context when making a decision.\n- If in doubt, use your best judgment and select the category that seems most fitting.\n- When extracting skills, be specific and avoid ambiguous terms.\n\nWhen extracting skills, include experience or education requirements if they are explicitly mentioned in the job description. However, do not assume their presence if it is not mentioned.\n\nReturn a JSON object with the following keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\"\n}\n\nInclude any additional notes or comments about skills that could not be categorized accurately.\n\nExample output format:\n```json\n{\n   \"technical_requirements\": \"Python, AWS, cloud technologies\",\n   \"business_requirements\": \"agile environment, project management\",\n   \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving, teamwork\"\n}\n```\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help the model perform better by providing clear guidelines and expectations. By explicitly stating that experience or education requirements should not be assumed, we are reducing the likelihood of errors.\n\nThe improved prompt also provides more guidance on how to handle ambiguous skills, which can lead to more accurate categorization. Additionally, the addition of a section for notes or comments allows the model to provide additional context when it is unable to categorize a skill accurately, giving the user a better understanding of the skill's relevance and importance.\n\nOverall, these changes should help the model extract skills more accurately and consistently, leading to an improved performance score.",
