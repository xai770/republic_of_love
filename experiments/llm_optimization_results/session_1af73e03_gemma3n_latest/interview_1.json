  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is not well-suited for the model's performance because it does not provide enough context about the job posting. The job title and description are not explicitly mentioned in the prompt, making it difficult for the model to accurately extract relevant skills.\n\nMoreover, the prompt asks for a specific JSON format, which may be too rigid and limiting for the model's output. The expected output type is also not clearly defined, as the provided output contains multiple categories (technical, business, soft skills, experience requirements, education requirements) instead of just one.\n\nAdditionally, the prompt does not specify whether the job posting should be a generic example or an actual job description from a real company. This ambiguity can lead to inconsistent results and affect the model's performance.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\n```json\nAnalyze a sample job posting (e.g., https://www.example.com/job-posting) and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n4. Experience Requirements: Years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels\n5. Education Requirements: Degrees, certifications, qualifications\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nExtract real skills mentioned in the job description. Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n```\n\nREASONING:\n\nThe improved prompt addresses the issues by providing a clear example of a job posting, specifying the expected output format, and defining the categories for skill extraction.\n\nBy using a sample job posting, we can ensure that the model is trained on consistent data and produces more accurate results. The specified output format will help the model understand what is required and produce a structured JSON object.\n\nThe added detail about extracting real skills mentioned in the job description ensures that the model focuses on identifying relevant skills rather than making assumptions or guessing. This should lead to more accurate and specific skill extraction.",
