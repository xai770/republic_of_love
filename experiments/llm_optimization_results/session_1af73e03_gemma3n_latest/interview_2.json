You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: gemma3n:latest\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: ```json\nAnalyze a sample job posting (e.g., https://www.example.com/job-posting) and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n4. Experience Requirements: Years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels\n5. Education Requirements: Degrees, certifications, qualifications\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nExtract real skills mentioned in the job description.

What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt has several issues that led to poor model performance.\n   - **Insufficient context**: The sample job posting link is not provided, making it difficult for the model to understand what skills are being extracted from a specific job description.\n   - **Lack of specificity in skill categories**: Although the model is trained on categorizing skills into technical, business, soft, experience, and education requirements, it doesn't provide any guidelines or examples to ensure accuracy in extracting these categories.\n   - **Ambiguous requirement specifications**: The prompt specifies exact JSON format but does not provide detailed instructions on how to handle ambiguous cases (e.g., what if a skill falls under multiple categories?).\n   - **Inadequate evaluation criteria**: The performance score of 0.00 indicates that the model was unable to extract any skills correctly, suggesting issues with understanding or processing the input data.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n```json\nAnalyze a sample job posting (e.g., \"Software Engineer\" job description) and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies; e.g., Python, Java, Agile\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions; e.g., cloud computing, project management\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities; e.g., collaboration, time management\n\nUse the following guidelines to categorize skills:\n- Technical: Programming languages, software development tools, technologies\n- Business: Domain knowledge, industry-specific processes, business functions\n- Soft: Communication skills, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nHandle ambiguous cases by prioritizing category based on relevance and context. If unsure, assume a skill belongs to the most relevant category.\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nExtract real skills mentioned in the job description. Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n\nExample output format:\n```json\n{\n   \"technical_requirements\": \"Python, AWS, cloud technologies\",\n   \"business_requirements\": \"agile environment, project management\",\n   \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving, teamwork\"\n}\n```\nREASONING:\n\n1. **Providing context**: By specifying a sample job posting (e.g., \"Software Engineer\") and requiring the model to analyze it, we ensure that the model understands what skills are being extracted from a specific job description.\n2. **Specific guidelines for skill categorization**: We provide clear instructions on how to categorize skills into technical, business, or soft categories, helping the model to prioritize and make accurate decisions.\n3. **Handling ambiguous cases**: By specifying guidelines for handling ambiguous cases (prioritizing category based on relevance and context), we help the model to avoid incorrect categorizations.\n4. **Improved evaluation criteria**: The revised prompt includes more detailed instructions, allowing us to evaluate the model's performance more accurately and identify areas for improvement.",
