  "interview_prompt": "\nYou are an expert LLM optimization consultant. You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: gemma3n:latest\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: ```json\nAnalyze a sample job posting (e.g., \"Software Engineer\" job description) and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies; e.g., Python, Java, Agile\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions; e.g., cloud computing, project management\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities; e.g., collaboration, time management\n\nUse the following guidelines to categorize skills:\n- Technical: Programming languages, software development tools, technologies\n- Business: Domain knowledge, industry-specific processes, business functions\n- Soft: Communication skills, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nHandle ambiguous cases by prioritizing category based on relevance and context. If unsure, assume a skill belongs to the most relevant category.\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nExtract real skills mentioned in the job description. Use semicolon separation. Be specific and accurate.\n\nExample output format:\n```json\n{\n   \"technical_requirements\": \"Python, AWS, cloud technologies\",\n   \"business_requirements\": \"agile environment, project management\",\n   \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving, teamwork\"\n}\n```\n- Model output: ```json\n{\n  \"technical_requirements\": \"Python; JavaScript; cloud technologies; AWS\",\n  \"business_requirements\": \"agile environment\",\n  \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving\",\n  \"experience_requirements\": \"3+ years\",\n  \"education_requirements\": \"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science\"\n}\n```\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt is overly specific and prescriptive, which may lead to model limitations.\n2. The use of the \"Handle ambiguous cases\" instruction may cause model overthink or misinterpretation of the task requirements.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: \n```json\nAnalyze a sample job posting (e.g., \"Software Engineer\" job description) and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1.

If in doubt, prioritize relevance and context.\n\nReturn a JSON object with the following keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\"\n}\n\nInclude experience or education requirements if they are explicitly mentioned in the job description.\n\nExample output format:\n```json\n{\n   \"technical_requirements\": \"Python, AWS, cloud technologies\",\n   \"business_requirements\": \"agile environment, project management\",\n   \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving, teamwork\"\n}\n```\n\nREASONING:\n\n1. Removed the explicit handling of ambiguous cases and let model determine relevance based on context.\n2. Modified \"experience_requirements\" and \"education_requirements\" to be included only if mentioned explicitly in job description.\n3. Made minor rewording for clarity.\n\nThis revised prompt is less prescriptive, allowing the model more flexibility while maintaining key requirements. The removal of ambiguous cases handling ensures that model makes more accurate assumptions based on task context.",
