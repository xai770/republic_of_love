  "interview_prompt": "\nYou are an expert LLM optimization consultant. You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: qwen2.5:7b\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and create a concise, professional summary that captures the key responsibilities and role overview.\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Create a 2-3 sentence summary of the main responsibilities\n2. Focus on what the person will actually DO in this role\n3. Include the most important aspects of the job\n4. Keep it professional and clear\n5. Return ONLY the summary text, no additional formatting\n\nSummary:\n- Model output: In this Data Analyst role, you will analyze large datasets to identify trends and insights, create reports, and provide actionable recommendations to support business decisions. You will collaborate closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and ensure that your analysis and findings are tailored to meet those requirements.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.70/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt asks the model to analyze a job posting and create a concise summary, but it lacks clarity on what specific aspects of the job description are relevant for the analysis.\n2. The prompt also does not provide enough guidance on the tone and style required for the output, which may lead to varied results.\n3. Furthermore, the expected output type (2-3 sentence professional summary) is not explicitly linked to the task requirements, potentially causing the model to focus on producing a specific structure rather than capturing the essence of the job responsibilities.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\nCreate a 2-3 sentence professional summary that captures the core responsibilities and key deliverables of this Data Analyst role. Focus on what the person will actually do in this position, including their main tasks and expected outcomes. Emphasize the most critical aspects of the job and ensure the summary is tailored to support business decisions.\n\nREASONING:\n\n1. By explicitly stating that the model should focus on the core responsibilities and key deliverables, we provide clearer guidance on what aspects of the job description are relevant for analysis.\n2. Adding \"Focus on what the person will actually do in this position\" helps the model understand that the summary should highlight the main tasks and expected outcomes rather than just providing a general overview.\n3. The phrase \"Emphasize the most critical aspects of the job and ensure the summary is tailored to support business decisions\" provides context for the output, ensuring that the model produces a concise and professional summary that captures the essence of the job responsibilities.\n\nThese changes should help the qwen2.5:7b model produce more accurate and relevant summaries by providing clear guidance on what aspects of the job description are important to analyze and how to structure the output.",
