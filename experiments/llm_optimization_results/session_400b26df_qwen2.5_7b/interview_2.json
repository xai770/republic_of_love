  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is somewhat clear and specific, but it could be improved in a few areas. The main issue lies in the wording and phrasing used to describe the expected output type, which is crucial for LLM model performance.\n\nOne potential issue with the prompt is that it assumes the reader is familiar with the term \"data-informed recommendations,\" which might not be the case. Additionally, the phrase \"enhance operational efficiency\" could be seen as somewhat vague and not directly related to the core responsibilities of a Data Analyst role.\n\nThe current output type specification (2-3 sentence professional summary) might also be too broad, leading the model to generate more content than what's actually needed.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nCreate a 2-3 sentence professional summary that outlines the primary duties and expected outcomes of this Data Analyst position, focusing on actionable insights that drive business decisions. Emphasize key deliverables such as data analysis reports, process optimization recommendations, and support for strategic planning initiatives.\n\nREASONING:\n\nTo improve the prompt, I made a few specific changes:\n\n1. Replaced \"drive data-driven decision-making\" with more concrete language to ensure the reader understands what is expected from the Data Analyst role.\n2. Changed \"developing predictive models\" to \"data analysis reports,\" which is more specific and directly related to the core responsibilities of a Data Analyst.\n3. Emphasized \"actionable insights\" to clarify that the model should focus on providing concrete, actionable information that supports business decisions.\n4. Retained key phrases like \"optimizing processes\" and \"supporting strategic planning initiatives\" to ensure the prompt remains relevant to the task.\n\nThese changes aim to improve clarity, specificity, and concision in the prompt, helping the qwen2.5:7b model generate a more accurate and relevant output that meets the expected type and length requirements.",
