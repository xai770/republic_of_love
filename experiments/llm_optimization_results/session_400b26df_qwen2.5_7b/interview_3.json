  "interview_prompt": "\nYou are an expert LLM optimization consultant. You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: qwen2.5:7b\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Create a 2-3 sentence professional summary that outlines the primary duties and expected outcomes of this Data Analyst position, focusing on actionable insights that drive business decisions. Emphasize key deliverables such as data analysis reports, process optimization recommendations, and support for strategic planning initiatives.\n- Model output: This Data Analyst position focuses on deriving actionable insights from complex datasets to drive informed business decisions. Key responsibilities include preparing comprehensive data analysis reports, proposing process optimizations based on data trends, and providing critical input into strategic planning initiatives to enhance operational efficiency and business performance.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.70/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt is overly descriptive and contains specific keywords that may not be directly related to the expected output format. This could lead to the model focusing on providing detailed explanations of each keyword rather than crafting a concise summary.\n2. The use of phrases such as \"derive actionable insights,\" \"prepare comprehensive data analysis reports,\" and \"provide critical input\" might suggest a more in-depth task, which doesn't align with the expected output type of 2-3 sentence professional summary.\n3. The model's output is too similar to what was provided in the training data or external sources, indicating that it may be relying on memorization rather than generating original content.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nCreate a concise and informative professional summary outlining the primary duties and expected outcomes of this Data Analyst position. Focus on key deliverables that drive business decisions, emphasizing insights and recommendations that support operational efficiency and enhanced performance.\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help improve the model's performance in several ways:\n\n1. By removing specific keywords and focusing on more general concepts (e.g., \"actionable insights\" instead of \"derive actionable insights\"), the prompt encourages the model to think more abstractly and generate a summary that is tailored to the task rather than relying on memorization.\n2. The revised prompt still conveys the importance of key deliverables but in a way that aligns with the expected output format, allowing the model to focus on crafting a concise summary rather than providing detailed explanations.\n3. By using more general language and phrasing, the improved prompt should allow the model to generate original content that is more unique and less reliant on external sources, ultimately improving the overall quality of the output.\n\nThese changes aim to strike a balance between providing enough guidance for the model while still allowing it to exercise its creative capabilities and produce high-quality output.",
