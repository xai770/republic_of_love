What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The primary issue with the current prompt is its lack of specificity and clarity, leading to a model output that is too general and lacks the detail required for concise description generation.\n2. Another issue is the use of vague terms like \"business growth\" and \"actionable insights,\" which don't provide enough direction for the model to produce relevant and specific information.\n3. The prompt also lacks context about the target audience, industry, or specific requirements of a Data Analyst role, making it difficult for the model to tailor its output accordingly.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nJob Title: Data Analyst\nIndustry: [specific industry, e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.]\n\nPlease provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the key tasks and responsibilities for this Data Analyst role, focusing on how data analysis drives business growth through actionable insights. Be sure to include specific examples or metrics that illustrate the impact of effective data-driven decision-making.\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help improve the model's performance in several ways:\n\n1. By specifying an industry, we provide a context for the model to generate more relevant and industry-specific information.\n2. The inclusion of specific requirements and metrics helps guide the model towards producing concise and actionable insights, rather than general statements.\n3. The phrase \"be sure to include specific examples or metrics\" encourages the model to provide concrete evidence to support its claims, which is essential for generating high-quality output in a concise description generation task.\n\nBy addressing these issues, we can improve the prompt's specificity, clarity, and relevance, allowing the llama3.2:latest model to generate more accurate and informative responses that meet the expected output type.",
