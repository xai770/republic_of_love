You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: llama3.2:latest\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and create a concise, professional summary that captures the key responsibilities and role overview.\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Create a 2-3 sentence summary of the main responsibilities\n2. Focus on what the person will actually DO in this role\n3. Include the most important aspects of the job\n4. Keep it professional and clear\n5. Return ONLY the summary text, no additional formatting\n\nSummary:\n- Model output: The Data Analyst will analyze large datasets to identify trends and patterns, create reports to present findings, and provide actionable recommendations to support business decisions. They will work closely with stakeholders to understand requirements and deliver insights that inform strategic choices. The successful candidate will utilize data visualization techniques to communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.70/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is overly broad and does not provide clear guidance for the model. The instruction to \"work closely with stakeholders\" is ambiguous, as it could imply that the model needs to understand human emotions or social cues, which is not a typical requirement for a data analyst role.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"utilize data visualization techniques to communicate complex information in a clear and concise manner\" is too vague. It does not specify what kind of data or visualizations are expected.\n\nFurthermore, the current prompt does not provide enough context about the specific dataset that the Data Analyst will be analyzing. This lack of specificity makes it difficult for the model to understand what key responsibilities and role overview to focus on.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the primary data sources and metrics used in this role, and describe how they will be analyzed.\n2. Create a 2-3 sentence summary of the main responsibilities, focusing on what the person will actually DO in this role.\n3. Highlight one specific business decision or strategic choice that the Data Analyst will inform through their analysis.\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help improve the model's performance because they provide more specificity and clarity about the task at hand. By identifying primary data sources and metrics, the model can better understand what kind of trends and patterns to look for. The revised prompt also focuses on what the person will actually DO in the role, rather than how they will interact with stakeholders.\n\nThe second instruction is more specific and actionable, allowing the model to generate a concise summary that captures the key responsibilities. Finally, the third instruction provides a clear direction for the model's output, ensuring that it provides actionable insights that inform strategic choices.\n\nBy providing these clarifications, the prompt becomes more targeted and effective, reducing the likelihood of the model generating overly broad or irrelevant summaries.",
