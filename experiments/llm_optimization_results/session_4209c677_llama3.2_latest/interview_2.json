  "interview_prompt": "\nYou are an expert LLM optimization consultant. You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: llama3.2:latest\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Job Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Identify the primary data sources and metrics used in this role, and describe how they will be analyzed.\n2. Create a 2-3 sentence summary of the main responsibilities, focusing on what the person will actually DO in this role.\n3. Highlight one specific business decision or strategic choice that the Data Analyst will inform through their analysis.\n- Model output: **Primary Data Sources and Metrics:**\n\nIn this role, the primary data sources will likely include:\n\n* Large datasets from various systems, such as databases, spreadsheets, and data warehouses\n* Transactional data, such as customer behavior, sales performance, and operational metrics\n* External data sources, such as market research, social media analytics, and competitor analysis\n\nThe Data Analyst will analyze these data sources to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform business decisions. Some specific metrics that may be analyzed include:\n\n* Sales revenue growth or decline\n* Customer acquisition and retention rates\n* Operational efficiency and cost savings opportunities\n* Market share and competitive positioning\n\n**Summary of Main Responsibilities:**\n\nAs a Data Analyst in this role, you will be responsible for analyzing large datasets to identify insights and trends that can inform business decisions. You will create reports and presentations to communicate your findings to stakeholders, providing actionable recommendations to drive business growth and improvement. Through close collaboration with stakeholders, you will work to understand their requirements and deliver data-driven solutions that support strategic objectives.\n\n**Business Decision or Strategic Choice:**\n\nOne specific business decision that the Data Analyst may inform through their analysis is the decision to launch a new product line. By analyzing customer behavior, market trends, and competitor analysis, the Data Analyst can provide insights on the potential success of a new product line, including factors such as:\n\n* Demand for similar products in the market\n* Customer segments with the highest likelihood of purchasing the new product\n* Potential pricing strategies to maximize profitability\n\nThrough their analysis, the Data Analyst can help stakeholders determine whether launching a new product line is a strategic choice that aligns with business objectives and provides a competitive advantage.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.20/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is concise but may not be fully optimizing the model's capabilities. The primary issues with the prompt are:\n\n1. Lack of specificity in task requirements: The prompt asks for a 2-3 sentence summary, focusing on what the person will \"actually DO\" in this role. However, it does not specify what actions or tasks should be emphasized.\n2. Ambiguous business decision context: While the prompt mentions a business decision (launching a new product line), it lacks detail about how the Data Analyst's analysis would inform this choice.\n3. Overemphasis on output quantity rather than quality: The performance score is based solely on quantity metrics, which may not be the most important aspect of this task.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nFor a 2-3 sentence summary, please describe the key tasks and responsibilities of this role, focusing on how the Data Analyst will drive business growth through data-driven insights. Additionally, provide an example of how their analysis might inform a specific business decision or strategic choice.\n\nPrimary Data Sources and Metrics:\n\nIn this role, the primary data sources will likely include:\n* Large datasets from various systems, such as databases, spreadsheets, and data warehouses\n* Transactional data, such as customer behavior, sales performance, and operational metrics\n\nThe Data Analyst should analyze these data sources to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform business decisions. Some specific metrics that may be analyzed include:\n* Sales revenue growth or decline\n* Customer acquisition and retention rates\n\nBusiness Decision or Strategic Choice:\n\nPlease describe how the Data Analyst's analysis of customer behavior, market trends, and competitor analysis might inform a strategic decision, such as launching a new product line.\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help the model perform better because they provide more specific guidance on task requirements and context. By emphasizing key tasks and responsibilities, the prompt encourages the model to focus on what is truly essential for this role. The addition of an example about how analysis informs a business decision helps the model understand the relevance of its output in real-world scenarios. Finally, by specifying the type of data sources and metrics to be analyzed, the prompt ensures that the model stays focused on relevant tasks, rather than trying to optimize for arbitrary quantity metrics.",
