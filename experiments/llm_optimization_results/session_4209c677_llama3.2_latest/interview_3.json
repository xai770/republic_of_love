  "interview_prompt": "\nYou are an expert LLM optimization consultant. You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: llama3.2:latest\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Job Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nFor a 2-3 sentence summary, please describe the key tasks and responsibilities of this role, focusing on how the Data Analyst will drive business growth through data-driven insights. Additionally, provide an example of how their analysis might inform a specific business decision or strategic choice.\n\nPrimary Data Sources and Metrics:\n\nIn this role, the primary data sources will likely include:\n* Large datasets from various systems, such as databases, spreadsheets, and data warehouses\n* Transactional data, such as customer behavior, sales performance, and operational metrics\n\nThe Data Analyst should analyze these data sources to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform business decisions. Some specific metrics that may be analyzed include:\n* Sales revenue growth or decline\n* Customer acquisition and retention rates\n\nBusiness Decision or Strategic Choice:\n\nPlease describe how the Data Analyst's analysis of customer behavior, market trends, and competitor analysis might inform a strategic decision, such as launching a new product line.\n- Model output: As a Data Analyst in this role, key tasks and responsibilities include analyzing large datasets to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that drive business growth through data-driven insights. The primary focus will be on creating actionable reports and recommendations to support business decisions.\n\nSome examples of how the Data Analyst's analysis might inform specific business decisions or strategic choices:\n\n* Analyzing customer behavior and sales performance to identify areas of high demand and optimize product offerings.\n* Examining market trends and competitor analysis to determine competitive advantages and potential market gaps, informing product line launches and marketing strategies.\n* Utilizing transactional data to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer acquisition and retention rates, helping the organization make informed decisions on resource allocation.\n\nIn the context of launching a new product line, the Data Analyst's analysis might inform strategic choices by identifying areas of high demand, competitive advantages, or market gaps. For instance:\n\n* A Data Analyst analyzing customer behavior data finds that there is a significant increase in interest for eco-friendly products and sustainable solutions.\n* Competitor analysis reveals that the company's main competitor has recently launched an eco-friendly product line with strong marketing and sales support.\n* Market trends indicate that consumers are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious, creating a high demand for sustainable products.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Data Analyst might recommend:\n\n1. Developing a new eco-friendly product line that addresses consumer demands and differentiates the company from competitors.\n2. Conducting market research to validate demand and assess competition before launching the new product line.\n3. Investing in targeted marketing campaigns highlighting the company's commitment to sustainability and eco-friendliness.\n\nBy providing data-driven insights, the Data Analyst can help inform strategic decisions that drive business growth through informed investments in products and marketing strategies that meet evolving customer demands.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.20/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1.

  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt appears to be partially relevant to the task, but it lacks clarity and specificity. The model is asked to provide a concise description of key tasks and responsibilities, but the language is too broad and doesn't give enough context for the Data Analyst role.\n\nAdditionally, the prompt mentions specific business decisions or strategic choices, but these are not clearly connected to the primary focus of the task: providing a 2-3 sentence professional summary of key tasks and responsibilities. The model's output seems to be more focused on explaining how data analysis can inform business decisions rather than summarizing the role.\n\nThe model's performance score suggests that it is struggling with coherence, relevance, and specificity. To improve performance, we need to make sure the prompt is clear, concise, and directly related to the task.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease provide a 2-3 sentence summary of the key tasks and responsibilities for this Data Analyst role, focusing on how data analysis drives business growth through actionable insights.\n\nREASONING:\n\nI made several changes to improve the prompt:\n\n1. I removed the extraneous sections about primary data sources and metrics, as they are not directly relevant to summarizing the key tasks and responsibilities of the role.\n2. I added a clear direction for the model's output, focusing on how data analysis drives business growth through actionable insights.\n3. I used more precise language, avoiding vague terms like \"drive business growth\" and instead using \"actionable insights\" to emphasize the importance of concrete recommendations.\n\nThese changes should help the model focus on providing a concise summary of key tasks and responsibilities, while also connecting to the broader goal of driving business growth through data analysis.",
