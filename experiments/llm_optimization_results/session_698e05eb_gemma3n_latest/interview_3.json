  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is too broad and lacks specificity, which may lead to a general and unspecific output. The model is expected to provide a concise summary of the job posting's key tasks and deliverables for data analysis and reporting aspects of the Data Analyst role within a 1-2 sentence limit. However, the prompt does not specify what exactly to look for in terms of key tasks and deliverables.\n\nImproving the prompt could involve adding more context or specific requirements to help the model focus on the desired information.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nFor a job posting describing the Data Analyst role, identify key data analysis and reporting tasks, including metrics or KPIs such as customer engagement rates, conversion numbers, and project timelines. Provide a concise summary of these responsibilities in approximately 1-2 sentences, highlighting primary deliverables and performance expectations.\n\nREASONING: \n\nThis revised prompt aims to provide more clarity on what specific information is required from the job posting. By adding the phrase \"including metrics or KPIs such as customer engagement rates, conversion numbers, and project timelines,\" it narrows down the focus of the model to key data analysis and reporting tasks relevant to the Data Analyst role. The added specificity should help the model generate a more accurate and concise summary that meets the performance score expectation.",
