  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is overly detailed and lengthy, which may have led to a few issues with the model's performance. Here are some key problems that could be contributing to the poor results:\n\n1. **Length of output**: The prompt requests a summary in 2-3 sentences, but the actual output exceeds this limit. This might cause the model to struggle with summarization and conciseness.\n2. **Too many tasks listed**: The prompt lists numerous data analysis and reporting tasks, which could lead to over-emphasis on some aspects at the expense of others. This may result in a focus on a few key areas rather than providing a comprehensive overview of the role.\n3. **Lack of context**: The prompt doesn't provide sufficient context for the Data Analyst role, making it difficult for the model to understand the nuances and responsibilities associated with this position.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nTo improve the performance of the gemma3n:latest model, we need to refine the prompt to better suit its capabilities. Here is a revised version:\n\n**For a job posting describing the Data Analyst role, provide a concise summary (2-3 sentences) highlighting primary deliverables and performance expectations. Emphasize key skills required for the position, including data analysis, reporting, and stakeholder communication.**\n\nKey aspects of the improved prompt include:\n\n* A more focused request for output length\n* A condensed list of essential tasks to avoid over-emphasis on certain areas\n* The addition of context clues (e.g., \"key skills required\") to help the model understand the nuances of the Data Analyst role\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help improve the performance of the gemma3n:latest model in several ways:\n\n1. **Concise output**: By specifying a shorter output length, we allow the model more flexibility and encourage it to provide a clear, concise summary that meets the requirements.\n2. **Focused tasks**: The revised prompt limits the number of tasks listed, ensuring that the model prioritizes essential responsibilities over less critical ones.\n3. **Contextual guidance**: Adding context clues helps the model understand the specific skills required for the Data Analyst role, enabling it to generate a more accurate and relevant summary.\n\nBy refining the prompt in this way, we can help the gemma3n:latest model produce high-quality outputs that better meet the needs of job postings and other applications.",
