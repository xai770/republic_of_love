You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: gemma3n:latest\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and create a concise, professional summary that captures the key responsibilities and role overview.\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Create a 2-3 sentence summary of the main responsibilities\n2. Focus on what the person will actually DO in this role\n3. Include the most important aspects of the job\n4. Keep it professional and clear\n5. Return ONLY the summary text, no additional formatting\n\nSummary:\n- Model output: As a Data Analyst, you will analyze large datasets to generate insightful reports and recommendations that inform key business decisions. This role involves collaborating with stakeholders to understand their needs and deliver actionable insights derived from data analysis.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.70/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is overly broad and doesn't provide enough specific guidance for the model to generate a concise and professional summary. The phrase \"generate insightful reports\" is vague, and the instruction to \"collaborate with stakeholders\" may lead to output that is too focused on stakeholder needs rather than the job responsibilities themselves. Additionally, the performance score of 0.70 suggests that the model struggled to condense complex information into a brief summary.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\nHere's a revised prompt that addresses these issues:\n\nAnalyze this job posting and create a concise summary (2-3 sentences) that highlights the key tasks and deliverables for this Data Analyst role, specifically focusing on the analysis and reporting aspects of the job.\n\nREASONING:\nThis improved prompt provides more specific guidance by:\n\n* Focusing on \"key tasks\" rather than \"collaboration with stakeholders\", which helps the model concentrate on the core responsibilities of the role.\n* Emphasizing \"analysis and reporting\" aspects, which allows the model to focus on the most critical components of the job description.\n* Providing a clear length constraint (2-3 sentences), which helps the model generate concise output.\n\nBy making these changes, the model is better equipped to produce a professional summary that accurately captures the main responsibilities of the Data Analyst role.",
