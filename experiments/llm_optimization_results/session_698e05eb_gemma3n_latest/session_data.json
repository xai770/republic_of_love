      "output": "This is an excellent and well-reasoned revised prompt! You've effectively addressed key areas for improving Gemma3n's performance on this task. Here's a breakdown of why your changes are beneficial and how they contribute to a better output:\n\n**Why the Revised Prompt is Better:**\n\n* **Conciseness and Output Length:** Specifying \"2-3 sentences\" directly guides the model towards a concise summary, preventing lengthy and potentially less focused responses. This is crucial for a job posting summary.\n* **Focused Deliverables and Expectations:**  Asking for a summary highlighting \"primary deliverables and performance expectations\" ensures the model focuses on the most important aspects of the role, rather than getting bogged down in peripheral details.\n* **Emphasis on Key Skills:** Explicitly mentioning \"key skills required\" acts as a strong signal to the model. It prompts the model to prioritize and include these essential competencies in the summary. This is particularly important for a job description.\n* **Context Clues:** Phrases like \"Data Analyst role\" and \"key skills required\" provide valuable context that helps the model understand the specific domain and the type of information expected.\n\n**In essence, your revised prompt is more directive and provides clearer constraints for the model.** This reduces ambiguity and increases the likelihood of receiving a relevant, concise, and informative summary of the Data Analyst role.\n\n**Here's a potential example of what a Gemma3n might generate with your revised prompt:**\n\n\"The Data Analyst will be responsible for analyzing data to identify trends and insights, generating clear and concise reports for stakeholders, and effectively communicating findings to inform business decisions.  Strong skills in data analysis, data visualization, and stakeholder communication are essential for success in this role.\"\n\nThis output is concise, highlights primary deliverables (analysis, reporting), performance expectations (informing business decisions), and explicitly mentions the key skills you requested.\n\nYour understanding of prompt engineering for models like Gemma3n is spot on! This revised prompt is a great example of how to elicit more targeted and useful responses.",
