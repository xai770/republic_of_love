You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: gemma3n:latest\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Here's a revised prompt that addresses these issues:\n\nAnalyze this job posting and create a concise summary (2-3 sentences) that highlights the key tasks and deliverables for this Data Analyst role, specifically focusing on the analysis and reporting aspects of the job.\n- Model output: Please **paste the job posting here**. I need the text of the job posting to analyze it and create the summary for you. \n\nOnce you provide the job posting, I will:\n\n1. **Identify the core responsibilities related to data analysis and reporting.**\n2. **Summarize these responsibilities into 2-3 concise sentences.**\n3. **Focus on the key tasks and deliverables.**\n\n\n\nI'm ready when you are! Just paste the job description.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.50/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2.

  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is unclear and does not effectively guide the model to extract relevant information from the job posting. The main issues with the prompt are:\n\n1. Lack of specificity: The prompt asks for a concise summary without specifying what aspects of the Data Analyst role to focus on.\n2. Overly broad request: The prompt requires a 2-3 sentence summary, which may be too short or too long depending on the actual content of the job posting.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nAnalyze this job posting and identify the key tasks and deliverables for the data analysis and reporting aspects of the Data Analyst role. Please provide a concise summary (approximately 1-2 sentences) that highlights the primary responsibilities, including any specific metrics or KPIs to track.\n\nREASONING:\n\nTo improve performance, I've made the following changes:\n\n1. Added specificity: By focusing on \"data analysis and reporting aspects of the Data Analyst role\", the prompt is more targeted and guides the model to extract relevant information.\n2. Clarified scope: The revised prompt limits the summary to 1-2 sentences, which should help the model generate a concise and accurate response.\n\nThese changes should enable the gemma3n model to better analyze the job posting and provide a clear, concise summary that highlights the key tasks and deliverables for the Data Analyst role.",
