You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: qwen2.5:7b\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n```\n{\n    \"Job Title\": \"{job_title}\",\n    \"Job Description\": \"{job_description}\"\n}\n```\nExtract specific skills mentioned in the job description related to:\n- Industry \"Technology\"\n- Job level \"Senior\"\n- Technical stack \"Java\"\n\nPlease categorize these skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nThis improved prompt adds specificity by:\n\n- Including industry, job level, and technical stack as relevant context\n- Asking for specific skills related to these areas, which should help the model focus on the most relevant information\n- Limiting the scope of the extraction task to reduce ambiguity\n- Model output: ```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"Python; JavaScript; AWS\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"strong problem-solving skills\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"3+ years of experience\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"Bachelor's degree in Computer Science\"\n}\n```\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is too broad and lacks specificity, leading to poor performance. The issues with the prompt are:\n\n1. Lack of context: The model is not provided with enough information about the job posting, making it difficult for the model to accurately extract relevant skills.\n2. Ambiguous task: The prompt asks the model to extract specific skills from the job description, but it does not specify how to determine which skills are relevant or how to categorize them.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\n```json\nAnalyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n```\n{\n    \"Job Title\": \"{job_title}\",\n    \"Job Description\": \"{job_description}\"\n}\nExtract specific skills mentioned in the job description related to:\n- Industry \"Technology\"\n  - Sub-industry \"Software Development\" or \"DevOps\"\n- Job level \"Senior\"\n- Technical stack \"Java\" or \"Java-based technologies\"\n \nPlease categorize these skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\n```\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help the model perform better by providing more context and specificity to the task. By including sub-industry information, job level, and technical stack, the prompt gives the model a clearer understanding of what skills are relevant and how to categorize them.\n\nAdditionally, by specifying that the skills should be related to \"Software Development\" or \"DevOps\", we reduce ambiguity and give the model a more focused task. The same applies to the requirement for Java-based technologies.\n\nThe other changes aim to improve the output format and reduce the number of categories required. By limiting the scope of the extraction task, we make it easier for the model to focus on the most relevant information and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n\nOverall, these changes should help the model perform better by providing more context, specificity, and clarity to the task, ultimately leading to an improved performance score.",
