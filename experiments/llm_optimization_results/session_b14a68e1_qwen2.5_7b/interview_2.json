You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: qwen2.5:7b\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nPlease extract and categorize skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n4. Experience Requirements: Years of experience, specific backgrounds, levels\n5. Education Requirements: Degrees, certifications, qualifications\n\nExtract specific skills mentioned in the job description related to:\n- Industry X (if applicable)\n- Job level Y (e.g., junior, senior)\n- Technical stack Z (e.g., Java, Python)\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nThis improved prompt adds specificity by:\n- Including industry, job level, and technical stack as relevant context\n- Asking for specific skills related to these areas, which should help the model focus on the most relevant information\n- Model output: ```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"Python; JavaScript; AWS\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"problem-solving abilities\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"3+ years of experience; Bachelor's degree in Computer Science\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt is too vague, leading to a lack of focus on specific requirements mentioned in the job posting.\n2. The model is not able to extract skills related to industry, job level, and technical stack due to the broad and general nature of these terms.\n3. The model's output lacks specificity and relevance to the task at hand.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nAnalyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n```\n{\n    \"Job Title\": \"{job_title}\",\n    \"Job Description\": \"{job_description}\"\n}\n```\nExtract specific skills mentioned in the job description related to:\n- Industry \"Technology\"\n- Job level \"Senior\"\n- Technical stack \"Java\"\n\nPlease categorize these skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\nThis improved prompt adds specificity by:\n\n- Including industry, job level, and technical stack as relevant context\n- Asking for specific skills related to these areas, which should help the model focus on the most relevant information\n- Limiting the scope of the extraction task to reduce ambiguity\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help improve the performance of the model by providing it with a clearer understanding of what is required. By specifying industry, job level, and technical stack, the model can target its skills extraction more precisely. Additionally, limiting the output format to a specific JSON structure will ensure consistency in the model's responses.\n\nWith these adjustments, the model should be able to extract skills related to Technology, Senior, Java with greater accuracy and provide more relevant information about business requirements, soft skills, experience requirements, and education requirements. This improved prompt should result in a performance score closer to 1.0.",
