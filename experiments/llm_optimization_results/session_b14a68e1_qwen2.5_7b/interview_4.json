You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: qwen2.5:7b\n- Task: Skills extraction from job posting\n- Current prompt: ```json\nAnalyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n```\n{\n    \"Job Title\": \"{job_title}\",\n    \"Job Description\": \"{job_description}\"\n}\nExtract specific skills mentioned in the job description related to:\n- Industry \"Technology\"\n  - Sub-industry \"Software Development\" or \"DevOps\"\n- Job level \"Senior\"\n- Technical stack \"Java\" or \"Java-based technologies\"\n \nPlease categorize these skills into:\n1. Technical Skills: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. Business Skills: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. Soft Skills: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"req1; req2; req3\"\n}\n\n```\n- Model output: ```json\n{\n    \"technical_requirements\": \"Python; JavaScript; AWS\",\n    \"business_requirements\": \"\",\n    \"soft_skills\": \"Strong problem-solving skills\",\n    \"experience_requirements\": \"3+ years of experience; Bachelor's degree in Computer Science\",\n    \"education_requirements\": \"\"\n}\n```\n- Expected output type: JSON with skills categories\n- Performance score: 0.00/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3.

  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The main issue with the current prompt is that it's overly specific and contains multiple conflicting requirements. For example, it asks for skills related to \"Java\" or \"Java-based technologies\", but also mentions \"Python\" and \"JavaScript\". This can lead to confusion and cause the model to focus on some aspects of the task at the expense of others.\n2. Another issue is that the prompt contains multiple categories (\"Technical Skills\", \"Business Skills\", etc.) with different expectations for each category. However, these categories are not explicitly defined in terms of specific keywords or phrases related to the job posting.\n3. Additionally, the prompt includes empty strings in some places (e.g., \"business_requirements\" and \"education_requirements\"), which can make it difficult for the model to determine what skills should be extracted.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\n```json\nAnalyze this job posting and extract skills in exactly this JSON format:\n```\n{\n    \"Job Title\": \"{job_title}\",\n    \"Job Description\": \"{job_description}\"\n}\nExtract specific skills mentioned in the job description related to:\n- Industry-specific keywords (e.g., \"software development\", \"DevOps\")\n  - Sub-industry-specific keywords (\"Software Development\" or \"DevOps\")\n- Job level-specific requirements (e.g., \"Senior-level experience required\")\n- Technical stack-related keywords (e.g., \"Java-based technologies\")\n\nExtract skills that fall into one of the following categories:\n1. **Technical Expertise**: Programming languages, software, tools, technologies\n2. **Industry Knowledge**: Domain knowledge, processes, methodologies, business functions\n3. **Soft Skills and Abilities**: Communication, leadership, teamwork, problem-solving abilities\n\nReturn ONLY a JSON object with these exact keys:\n{\n    \"technical_expertise\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\",\n    \"industry_knowledge\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\", \n    \"soft_skills_and_abilities\": \"skill1; skill2; skill3\"\n}\n\n```\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help improve the model's performance in several ways:\n\n* By reducing the number of conflicting requirements, we can make it easier for the model to focus on extracting relevant skills from the job posting.\n* By explicitly defining the categories and keywords related to each category, we can give the model a clearer understanding of what skills are being sought.\n* By removing empty strings from the prompt, we can ensure that the model has enough information to extract accurate skills.\n* By using more general keywords (e.g., \"Industry-specific keywords\") rather than specific sub-industry keywords, we can allow the model to extract skills related to multiple sub-industries and improve its overall accuracy.",
