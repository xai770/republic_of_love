  "interview_prompt": "\nYou are an expert LLM optimization consultant. You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: deepseek-r1:8b\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Analyze the job posting and create a professional summary (2-3 sentences) highlighting key responsibilities, such as analyzing large datasets, generating insights, and reporting findings. Focus on what the person will actually do in this role.\n- Model output: Thinking...\nOkay, user wants me to analyze a job posting and extract 2-3 sentence summaries focusing on actual tasks like data analysis, insight generation, and reporting. \n\nHmm, they're probably someone HR or hiring manager who needs quick candidate briefs without reading full listings. Or maybe a job seeker scanning roles for relevance? The way they phrased it suggests they prioritize concrete action verbs over fluffy descriptions.\n\nThe query is crisp but missing the actual posting text - that's crucial since I can't access external files here. User might be testing my approach or forgot to attach it. \n\nSince no specific post exists, I'll demonstrate how an ideal summary would look by creating a hypothetical one about \"Senior Data Analyst\". Need to cover: \n- Active work verbs (analyze, interpret etc)\n- Mention of reporting mechanism (Dashboards, stakeholders) \n- Quantify value (\"drive business decisions\") rather than just list tasks\n\nUser seems methodical - they specified sentence count and content focus. Should mirror their precision in response structure while keeping it natural for job seekers to scan.\n\nWait... but what if the real posting has different nuances? Maybe I should offer two options showing variation in reporting style or dataset complexity emphasis. Though without seeing the actual text, this feels risky. Better stick close to hypothetical example unless they provide more context.\n...done thinking.\n\nOkay, please provide the job posting you would like me to analyze.\n\nHowever, based on a *typical* job posting for such a role (since no specific post was provided), here is a professional summary highlighting key responsibilities:\n\n**Example Summary:**\n\nThis position involves analyzing large-scale and complex datasets using advanced statistical methods and data modeling. The individual will interpret findings to generate actionable business insights and communicate results effectively through reports, presentations, and dashboards for various stakeholders. They will play a crucial role in driving data-driven decision-making within the organization.\n\n**(If you provide the actual job posting text, I can give a more precise summary based on its specific details.)**\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.20/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\nThe current prompt is incomplete and lacks specificity, leading to a suboptimal performance score. The model struggles to generate an accurate summary due to the lack of context and details about the job posting.\n\nOne issue with the prompt is that it assumes the existence of the job posting text, but doesn't provide any information about its contents. This leads to a generic response that doesn't take into account the specific requirements or nuances of the actual posting.\n\nAnother problem with the prompt is that it focuses too much on general concepts (e.g., \"concrete action verbs\") rather than providing clear guidance on what specific aspects of the job posting should be emphasized in the summary. This makes it difficult for the model to generate a high-quality response that meets the user's requirements.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nPlease provide the actual job posting text for this position: Senior Data Analyst (or any similar role). Analyze the posting and create a professional summary highlighting key responsibilities, focusing on specific tasks such as analyzing large datasets, interpreting findings, and reporting insights. The summary should ideally cover 2-3 concrete action verbs (e.g., analyze, interpret, report) and mention a suitable reporting mechanism (e.g., dashboards, stakeholders). Additionally, aim to quantify the value of this role in terms of driving business decisions or improving organizational performance.\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes improve the prompt by providing clear guidance on what aspects of the job posting should be emphasized in the summary. By specifying the role and requesting the actual posting text, we can ensure that the model generates a more accurate and relevant response.\n\nBy focusing on specific tasks (e.g., analyzing large datasets) and reporting mechanisms (e.g., dashboards), we can help the model identify the most important aspects of the job posting and generate a summary that effectively communicates these details.\n\nQuantifying the value of this role in terms of driving business decisions or improving organizational performance adds an additional layer of clarity to the prompt, helping the model to generate a more concrete and actionable summary.",
