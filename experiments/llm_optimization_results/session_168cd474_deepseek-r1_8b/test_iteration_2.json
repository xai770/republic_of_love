  "output": "Thinking...\nOkay, user wants me to analyze a job posting and extract 2-3 sentence summaries focusing on actual tasks like data analysis, insight generation, and reporting. \n\nHmm, they're probably someone HR or hiring manager who needs quick candidate briefs without reading full listings. Or maybe a job seeker scanning roles for relevance? The way they phrased it suggests they prioritize concrete action verbs over fluffy descriptions.\n\nThe query is crisp but missing the actual posting text - that's crucial since I can't access external files here. User might be testing my approach or forgot to attach it. \n\nSince no specific post exists, I'll demonstrate how an ideal summary would look by creating a hypothetical one about \"Senior Data Analyst\". Need to cover: \n- Active work verbs (analyze, interpret etc)\n- Mention of reporting mechanism (Dashboards, stakeholders) \n- Quantify value (\"drive business decisions\") rather than just list tasks\n\nUser seems methodical - they specified sentence count and content focus. Should mirror their precision in response structure while keeping it natural for job seekers to scan.\n\nWait... but what if the real posting has different nuances? Maybe I should offer two options showing variation in reporting style or dataset complexity emphasis. Though without seeing the actual text, this feels risky. Better stick close to hypothetical example unless they provide more context.\n...done thinking.\n\nOkay, please provide the job posting you would like me to analyze.\n\nHowever, based on a *typical* job posting for such a role (since no specific post was provided), here is a professional summary highlighting key responsibilities:\n\n**Example Summary:**\n\nThis position involves analyzing large-scale and complex datasets using advanced statistical methods and data modeling. The individual will interpret findings to generate actionable business insights and communicate results effectively through reports, presentations, and dashboards for various stakeholders. They will play a crucial role in driving data-driven decision-making within the organization.\n\n**(If you provide the actual job posting text, I can give a more precise summary based on its specific details.)**",
