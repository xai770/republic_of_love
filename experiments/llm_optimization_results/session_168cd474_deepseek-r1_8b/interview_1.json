You need to analyze why a model didn't perform well and suggest improvements to the prompt.\n\nCONTEXT:\n- Model being tested: deepseek-r1:8b\n- Task: Concise description generation\n- Current prompt: Analyze this job posting and create a concise, professional summary that captures the key responsibilities and role overview.\n\nJob Title: {job_title}\nJob Description: {job_description}\n\nInstructions:\n1. Create a 2-3 sentence summary of the main responsibilities\n2. Focus on what the person will actually DO in this role\n3. Include the most important aspects of the job\n4. Keep it professional and clear\n5. Return ONLY the summary text, no additional formatting\n\nSummary:\n- Model output: Thinking...\nOkay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a concise, professional summary for a Data Analyst position based on the job posting provided.\n\nFirst, I need to extract key responsibilities from the description. The main points mentioned are analyzing large datasets, creating reports, providing insights for business decisions, and collaborating with stakeholders. So those four areas should be covered in the summary.\n\nThe user specified 2-3 sentences focusing on actual tasks. That means each sentence needs to highlight a core activity without fluff. I'll consider structuring it into two parts: one about analyzing data and generating insights, another about creating reports and stakeholder collaboration.\n\nI wonder who might use this summary? Probably someone preparing a job application or crafting a resume. They need to quickly understand the role's essence for tailoring their experience. The user wants clarity on what the person actually does, so emphasizing execution and communication is key.\n\nAlso considering deeper needs: maybe they're looking to align their skills with the job's requirements effectively. Highlighting analytical tasks like querying databases and interpreting data will resonate with candidates who want to showcase those abilities. Including stakeholder interaction shows the role involves teamwork, which might be important for someone seeking collaborative environments.\n...done thinking.\n\nAnalyze large datasets using various tools and techniques to identify trends and patterns. Generate actionable business insights through comprehensive reporting and clear communication of findings to stakeholders. Collaborate closely with team members to understand specific requirements and deliver data-driven recommendations that support decision-making processes.\n- Expected output type: 2-3 sentence professional summary\n- Performance score: 0.20/1.0\n\nANALYSIS NEEDED:\n1. What went wrong with the current prompt?\n2. How can the prompt be improved?\n3. What specific changes would help this model perform better?\n\nPlease provide:\n1. Brief analysis of the issues\n2. Specific improved prompt (complete, ready to use)\n3. Reasoning for the changes\n\nFormat your response as:\nANALYSIS: [your analysis]\nIMPROVED_PROMPT: [complete improved prompt]\nREASONING: [why these changes should help]\n",
  "interview_response": "ANALYSIS:\n\n1. The current prompt is too detailed and doesn't provide clear guidance on the expected output format or tone.\n2. The prompt mentions \"executing\" tasks, which implies a more complex process than what's required for a concise summary.\n3. The mention of \"stakeholder interaction\" and \"teamwork\" is not directly relevant to creating a 2-3 sentence summary.\n\nIMPROVED_PROMPT:\n\nAnalyze the job posting and create a professional summary (2-3 sentences) highlighting key responsibilities, such as analyzing large datasets, generating insights, and reporting findings. Focus on what the person will actually do in this role.\n\nREASONING:\n\nThese changes should help because they simplify the prompt and focus on the core requirements of creating a concise summary. By specifying the expected output format (2-3 sentence professional summary) and emphasizing key responsibilities, the model is given clear guidance on how to structure its response. Removing the extraneous language related to stakeholder interaction and teamwork will allow the model to concentrate on the essential tasks involved in the role, leading to a more accurate and concise summary.",
