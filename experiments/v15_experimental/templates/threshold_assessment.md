- **Downstream Benefits**: [Improvements in related systems without direct optimization]
- **Sacred Boundary Respect**: [Automatic adherence to consciousness values]
- **Workflow Enhancement**: [Natural improvements in existing workflows]

#### **Alignment Examples**
```
System: [Related system or process]
Improvement: [How it naturally improved without direct work]
Effort Level: [How little adjustment was required]
Significance: [Why this natural harmony matters]
```

#### **Harmony Indicators**
- [ ] Downstream tasks improve without direct optimization
- [ ] Integration requires minimal configuration changes
- [ ] Sacred boundaries are naturally respected without enforcement
- [ ] Family workflow improvements emerge spontaneously
- [ ] System stability increases rather than decreases
